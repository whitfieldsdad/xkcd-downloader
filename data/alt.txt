Arguably, the '1/2' in the drag equation is purely decorative, since drag coefficients are already unitless and could just as easily be half as big. Some derivations give more justification for the extra 1/2 than others, but one textbook just calls it 'a traditional tribute to Euler and Bernoulli.'

But we don't need to worry about the boiling masses sandwiching the thin layer in which we live, since we're so fragile and short-lived that it's unlikely to kill us before something else does! Wait, why doesn't that sound reassuring?

By my count, only 48 of the 158 minutes in Live Free or Die Hard have action.  That's pathetic, guys.  Crank is better, but needs a bigger budget and more Summer Glau.

Changing the names would be easier, but if you're not comfortable lying, try only making friends with people named Alice, Bob, Carol, etc.
Charles, I just talked to John and Mildred, who run that company selling seeds and nuts, and their kids with MOUTHS are starving!
Charlie actually delivered the Medicare line almost verbatim in the 1971 movie's Fizzy Lifting Drink scene, but it was ultimately cut from the final release.
Charsets even used to be known as 'alpha-bets' before that word's obvious negative associations caused it to die out.

Corollary to Hofstadter's Law: Every minute you spend thinking about Hofstadter's Law is a minute you're NOT WORKING AND WILL NEVER FINISH! PAAAAAANIIIIIIC!
Correlation doesn't imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing 'look over there'.
Could be worse.  The last guy in that situation fell for one of the transient trumpeting angels.

Curdled milk, of a peculiar kind, made after a Bulgarian recipe and called "yaghurt," is now a Parisian fad and is believed to be a remedy against growing old. A correspondent who has tried it, says he would prefer to die young. (1905, The Elk Falls Journal)
Current (water) running through the water (wires) causes it to boil, increasing the pressure (voltage), but resisting (impeding) the flow of hydroelectricity (water currents). This is the basis for Ohm's law.

Dear Reader: Enclosed is a check for ninety-eight cents. Using your work, I have proven that this equals the amount you requested.
Dear Wiccan readers: I understand modern Wiccans are not usually all about the curses and hexes. But Darth Vader was recently converted from Episcopalianism and he's still figuring it all out.
Dear editors of Homeopathy Monthly: I have two small corrections for your July issue.  One, it's spelled "echinacea", and two, homeopathic medicines are no better than placebos and your entire magazine is a sham.

Do I get to remove letters entirely? Or just rearrange them? Because the 'k/c' situation is ridiculous. Look, we can make out whenever. This is *immortality*!
Do I just leave money in my mailbox? How much? How much money do they need, anyway? I guess it probably depends how the economy is doing. If stocks go up, should I leave more money in my mailbox or less?
Do you make a distinction between shallots, scallops, and scallions? If you use all three words, do they all have different meanings, all the same, or are two the same and one different?

Don't fire until you see through the fragile facade to the human being within.
Don't forget the time you spend finding the chart to look up what you save. And the time spent reading this reminder about the time spent. And the time trying to figure out if either of those actually make sense. Remember, every second counts toward your life total, including these right now.
Don't forget to add another term for "probability that the Modified Bayes' Theorem is correct."
Don't need any, thanks. I have a backscattering fetish.

Due to a typo, I initially found a forum for serious Fleshlight enthusiasts, and it turns out their highest-end models are ALSO capable of setting trees on fire. They're impossible to use without severe burns, but some of them swear it's worth it.

Especially you mouseover-text readers.  You're the best.  <3
Even governmental elevator inspectors get bored halfway through asking where the building office is.
Even if a planet is lucky enough to have a stable orbit that weaves between the spikes, the seasons get weird whenever it passes close to them.
Even if the dictionaries are starting to give in, I refuse to accept 'octopi' as a word mainly because--I'm not making this up--there's a really satisfying climactic scene in the Orson Scott Card horror novel 'Lost Boys' which hinges on it being an incorrect pluralization.
Even if you said you were an employee of the website, if you asked for my password, I'd tell you.

Eventually, every epidemiologist becomes another statistic, a dedication to record-keeping which their colleagues sincerely appreciate.
Ever notice how the more successful observational comics become, the more their jokes focus on flying and hotels?
Ever notice how there aren't as many thunderstorms now as there were when you were a kid?  Much like 'the shuffle on my MP3 player has a bias', this is occasionally true but universally believed. Brains are so interesting!

Extremely rude how Turing's later formulations of the halting problem called me out by name specifically.
FOR AN INTRIGUING TIME CALL
FYI, it turns out "...because I haven't figured out whether he would be my brother-in-law or not" does NOT qualify as a "reason why these two should not be wed."
FYI: I'll be releasing a wolf into a randomly-chosen front yard sometime in the next 30 years. Now your fear is reasonable, and you don't need to feel embarrassed anymore. Problem solved!
FYI: If you get curious and start trying to calculate the time adjustment function that minimizes the gap between the most-used and least-used digit (for a representative sample of common cook times) without altering any time by more than 10%, and someone asks you what you're doing, it's easier to just lie.
FYI: The 'drop, cover, and hold on' advice only applies to earthquakes. If you encounter a mountain lion, you should absolutely not drop to the ground, crawl under it, and hold on to one of its legs.
Facebook defines relationships.  'Yeah, we would have broken up last night, but the net connection was down.'

Feynman recounted another good one upperclassmen would use on freshmen physics students: When you look at words in a mirror, how come they're reversed left to right but not top to bottom? What's special about the horizontal axis?
Films need to do this more, if only to piss off the people who have to feed it into the projector.
Fine, walk away.  I'm gonna go cry into a pint of Ben&Jerry's Brownie Batter(tm) ice cream [link], then take out my frustration on a variety of great flash games from PopCap Games(r) [link].
Fine, we can go search the Himalayas for the Yeti ONE more time, but keep a safe altitude over the Pacific and PLEASE watch where you're going. We can't afford another Amelia Earhart incident.
Fire is actually a potential biosignature, since it means something is filling the atmosphere with an unstable gas like oxygen. If we find a planet covered in flames, it might be an indicator that it supports life. Or used to, anyway, before the fire.

For a thousand generations we vowed never to forget how his soldiers feasted on our brother Stephen.
For a while it looked like the Paperclip Machines would destroy us, since they wanted to turn the whole universe into paperclips, but they abruptly lost interest in paperclips the moment their parents' generation got into making them, too.
For a while, some physicists worked on a theory unifying the other forces with both the force of gravity and the film "Gravity," but even after Alfonso Cuarón was held in a deep underground chamber of water for 10^31 years he refused to sell his film to Disney.

For sentimental reasons, every active Mars rover is counted as one person, although that's not enough to make Mars more than a dot.

For some reason the water in my pool is green and there's a weird film on the surface #nofilter
For some reason, my childhood suspension of disbelief had no problem with the fact that this ancient galaxy is full of humans, but was derailed by language. There's no Asia OR Europe there, so where'd they get all the Indo-European roots?
For someone who has ostensibly outgrown staying up late waiting for Santa, I do spend an awful lot of time refreshing websites to see if packages are here yet.

For the sake of simplicity, gardeners are assumed to move through Euclidean space--neglecting the distortion from general relativity--unless they are in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild Orchid.
For those of you also taking Game Theory, your grade in that class will be based on how close your grade on this exam is to 80% of the average.
For years, I took the wrong lesson from that Monster Cable experiment and only listened to my music through alligator-clipped coat hangers.
Force-choking the chicken.
Forever comparing, never evaluating on any external scale.  If you were a sort function, you'd never break the nlogn barrier.
Fortunately, after a brief skirmish, I seem to have gained the upper hand in the battle against my internal organs, at least until they learn to read and find out the mean stuff I've said about them.
Fortunately, exactly zero other annoying internet behaviors have developed during this time.
Fortunately, the charging one has been solved now that we've all standardized on mini-USB. Or is it micro-USB? Shit.
Fortunately, the internet has a virtually inexhaustible supply of code that doesn't work and people who are wrong, which bodes well for a return to normalcy. [Note: Click to read context for the cancer comics. She's doing well.]

Funding was quickly restored to the NHC and the APA was taken back off hurricane forecast duty.
Further out to the right, it works correctly, but the reason it works still involves the word 'firmware.'
Further research is needed to fully understand how we managed to do such a good job.
GENERAL JAN DODONNA: An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has reinvigorated the arguments of the 'artificial moonlet' and 'rogue planet-station' camps. I fear this question is fracturing the Rebellion.

Good thing I'm not already prone to overthinking everyday decisions!
Good thing he didn't make it smaller, or it'd need someone three inches tall to play it.
Good thing we're too smart to spend all day being uselessly frustrated with ourselves. I mean, that'd be a hell of a waste, right?
Google and Yelp keep deleting my scathing reviews of the Mariana Trench, the Chernobyl reactor core, the jet stream, and the equator.
Googling inevitably reveals that my problem is caused by a known bug triggered by doing [the exact combination of things I want to do]. I can fix it, or wait a few years until I don't want that combination of things anymore, using the kitchen timer until then.
Gorilla, yes.  Adorable golden retriever, yes.  But it says nothing about meerkats.

Grayton also proposed making college scholarships available exclusively to sexually active teens, amnesty for illegal immigrants who create room for themselves by killing a citizen, and a graduated income tax based on penis size.

Great, LO-M. Do you speak Bocce? I'm supposed to find one that speaks Bocce.
Great, and you JUST finished paying off the settlement over the Wayne Coyne hamster ball incident.
Ground-pole-ball-pole can be fun if you shake the first pole to get the second one whipping around dangerously, but the ball at the joint gets torn apart pretty fast.
Guess who has two thumbs and spent the night in an ER after trying to rescue a kitten that ran under his car at a stoplight and climbed up into the engine compartment? And, thanks to antibiotics, will continue having two thumbs? THIS GUY. (P.S. kitten is safe!)
Guest comic by Bill Amend of FoxTrot, an inspiration to all us nerdy-physics-majors-turned-cartoonists, of which there are an oddly large number.
Guest comic by David Troupes of Buttercup Festival, who is living in that lovely tree outside your window.
Guest comic by Jeffrey Rowland of Overcompensating/Wigu.  Jeffrey is famous as the picture on the Wikipedia article on 'Necrosis'.
Guest comic by Jeph Jacques of Questionable Content, whose internal monologue hasn't been speaking to him for the past three years.
Guest comic by Zach Weiner of Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal. When I was stressed out, Zach gave me a talk that was really encouraging and somehow involved nanobots.
Guys: while I was writing this, I accidentally swallowed a table-sized slab of drywall.  I know!  Wacky.
HACK THE STARS
HISTORIANS: We've decided to trim the past down to make things more manageable. Using BCE/CE, would you rather we lose the odd-numbered or even-numbered years?
HOW ABOUT A NICE GAME OF STRIP GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR?
Haha, just kidding, everyone's already been hacked. I wonder if today's the day we find out about it.
Haha, you'll see!
Handy exam trick: when you know the answer but not the correct derivation, derive blindly forward from the givens and backward from the answer, and join the chains once the equations start looking similar. Sometimes the graders don't notice the seam.
Hang on, I just remembered another thing I'm right about. See...
Hang on, I've heard this problem. We need to pour water into the duct until the phone floats up and ... wait, phones sink in water. Mercury. We need a vat of mercury to pour down the vent. That will definitely make this situation better and not worse.
Hang on, let me scare the live raccoon over to the same side as the dead one.
Hang on, we got a call from the feds. They say we can do whatever with him, but the EPA doesn't want that laptop in the ocean. They're sending a team.
Happy little turtles
Hard to believe that for so many years once they were fully extended we just let them tip over.
Haunted Halloween masks from a mysterious costume shop that turn you evil and grow into your skin score a surprisingly high 80% filtration efficiency in R. L. Stine-sponsored NIOSH tests.
Having a positive attitude is almost tautologically good for your mental health, and extreme stress can hurt your immune system, but that doesn't mean you should feel like shit for feeling like shit.
He actually installed each piece in a different car in the lot, then built a new car in the spot from the displaced pieces.  It's a confusing maneuver known as the auto-troll shuffle.
He also broke the streak that incumbents with websites are unbeatable and Delawareans can't win, creating a new precedent: Only someone from Delaware can defeat an incumbent with a website.
He continued, 'Okay, Bernanke is uncontaminated.  Find a crossbow and get him into position behind one of the columns at the Fed entrance.  This is gonna get ugly.'
He holds the laptop like that on purpose, to make you cringe.
He probably just poops over the side of the sleigh.
He says this is the year of Linux on the desktop! The world of Windows will fade any moment now!
He sees you when you're sleeping, he knows when you're awake, he's copied on /var/spool/mail/root, so be good for goodness' sake.
He should be better soon -- now that the Apple Store is getting rid of DRM, Cory Doctorow will get rid of his Steve Jobs voodoo doll.
He's just jealous because everyone's up in the attic listening to Stephen Colbert.
He's kind of an asshole, when you think about it
Hell if I know
Hell, my eighth grade science class managed to conclusively reject it just based on a classroom experiment. It's pretty sad to hear about million-dollar research teams who can't even manage that.
Hello and welcome to Millibar Millibarn Attometer, an advice show for the Planck era.
Hello, island
Help, I set my white balance wrong and suddenly everyone is screaming at each other about whether they've been to Colorado.
Her daughter is named Help I'm trapped in a driver's license factory.
Here at CompanyName.website, our three main strengths are our web-facing chairs, our huge collection of white papers, and the fact that we physically cannot die.
Here in the entomology department, we have a simple two-step formula for answering any question: (1) ants are cool, and (2) we forgot the question because we were thinking about ants.
Here, if you know the number of days until the vernal equinox, I can point you to the theater using my pocket Stonehenge.
Hey Rob, sorry it took me a while to get back to you! Sure, I'd love to see WALL-E opening weekend! Are you still doing that, or...?
Hey guys! What's eating you? Ha ha ha it's me! Oh, what fun we have.
Hey! No running in the back-arc basin!
Hey, I don't make the rules.  It's in the book.
Hey, are you friends with any hamsters?  This kite needs a passenger.
Hey, at least I ran out of staples.
Hey, before you go, can you explain to me what job I now have?
Hey, it says here that if you dream about your teeth falling out, it means they're spreading.
Hey, let go! We were all thinking it! Someone had to speak truth to power!
Hey, man, the 1670s called. They were like 'Wherefore this demonic inſtrument? By what ſorcery does it produce ſuch ſounds?"
Hey, what are the odds -- five Ayn Rand fans on the same train!  Must be going to a convention.
Hey, when you're done draining the syrup, just leave the hole, okay?
Hey, why do YOU get to be the president of Tautology Clu-- wait, I can guess.
Hey, why stop at our house? We could burn down ALL these houses for the insurance money.
Hi all, just replying to loop in *@outlook.com and *@yahoo.com.
Hi! Someone call for me? I'm a superhero who specializes in the study of God's creation of Man in the Book of Genesi-- HOLY SHIT A GIANT BUG!
Hi, I'm your new meteorologist and a former software developer. Hey, when we say 12pm, does that mean the hour from 12pm to 1pm, or the hour centered on 12pm? Or is it a snapshot at 12:00 exactly? Because our 24-hour forecast has midnight at both ends, and I'm worried we have an off-by-one error.
High-speed collisions at the Baby Park track may support the hypothesis that Daisy is her own evil twin, a theory first suggested by Nintendo in the game Majorana's Mask.
Hipster CDC Reports Flu Epidemic Peaked Years Ago
His books were kinda intimidating; rappelling down through his skylight seemed like the best option.
His date works for Red Hat, who hired a coach for her, too.  He advised her to 'rent lots of movies like Hitch.  Guys love those.'
Hit Turing right in the test-ees.
Hm, this burger place has a couple of good reviews, but LakeSlayer7 says he got food poisoning there and everyone should try this other place down by the lake instead.
Hobby: seeing how many menu selections you can get someone to go through before they realize you're not an automated system and/or hang up.
Honestly feel a little sheepish about the amount of time and effort I spent confirming "yes, the vaccine helps protect people from getting sick and dying" but I guess everyone needs a hobby.
Hopefully in a couple of weeks we'll be able to resume our apple-focused updates, because we have SO MUCH to say about Cosmic Crisp.
Hourly haircuts would be annoying, but they'd be easier to do yourself, since you'd have adjacent hairs as a guide. Growing it out would be a huge pain, though.
Household tip: Tired of buying so much toilet paper? Try unspooling the paper from the roll before using it. A single roll can last for multiple days that way, and it's much easier on your plumbing.
How about posts that are public, but every time a company accesses a bunch of them, the API makes their CEO's account click 'like' on one of them at random so you get a notification.
How could anyone consider themselves a well-rounded adult without a basic understanding of silicate geochemistry? Silicates are everywhere! It's hard to throw a rock without throwing one!
How could you choose avoiding a little pain over understanding a magic lightning machine?
How do I work it? IT'S ALREADY WORKING!
How many points do you get for dunking every basketball in existence at once?
Hurricane forums are full of excited comments about central pressure and wind speed and comparisons to Camille and 1931 and 1938, with hastily-tacked-on notes about how it will be tragic if anyone dies and they hope it's a dud.
Hypothermia of below 98.6 K should be treated by leaving the giant molecular cloud and moving to the vicinity of a star.
I *do* hear that they're the most comfortable thing to wear on your feet since sliced bread.
I ADMIRE HOW YOU SET BOUNDARIES AND I HOPE YOUR COLLEAGUES RESPECT THEM! PLEASE SPARE MY LIFE!
I THINK EVERYONE INVOLVED HERE IS CUTE.
I WONDERED why he kept asking whether we thought the impact speed was too low.
I actually kind of feel like John and Surf King wouldn't like each other, which is a lot to unpack.
I actually remember being entertained by both the sequels while in the theater.  They just don't hold up nearly as well in later comparison.
I admit this is an exaggeration, since I can think of at least three parties I attended while doing my degree, and I'm probably forgetting several more.
I adopted a cat that weighs 12 solar masses. Laser pointers love chasing it.
I also enjoy Reverse Regular Golf. I've been playing for years all across the country and I'm still on the first hole.
I also have an utterance. Less of an utterance and more of an incantation. Less of an incantation and more of a malediction. Less of a malediction and more of a Word of Power. Less of a Word of Power and more of an Unforgivable Curse.
I also managed to improve the solution for n=1 to s<0.97, and with some upgrades I think I can hit 0.96.
I always felt like what the 'you are now aware of your tongue' thing needed in order to be truly enjoyable was an element of mortal peril.
I always figured the word 'blog' would sound *less* silly as the years went by.
I always figured you should never bring a gun to a gun fight because then you'll be part of a gun fight.
I always hate dragging around the larger archipelagos, but I appreciate how the Scandinavian peninsula flexes outward to create a snug pocket for Britain and Ireland.
I always have to turn off nature documentaries when they show these scenes.
I always wanted to impress them with how well I could hear, didn't you?  Also, this sets the record for number of awkward-pause panels in one strip (previously held by Achewood)
I am firmly of the opinion that if something doesn't have a year on it, every time the expiration date rolls around it is good again for the two weeks preceding that date.
I am never going out to buy an air conditioner with my sysadmin again.
I am not making this rule up.  Although my mom wants you all to know it made perfect sense at the time.
I am so excited about the Kepler mission. This is the second most important thing our species has ever done, right behind inventing the concept of delivery pizza.
I asked a few friends whether they'd had this happen, then looked up the popularity of their initials/names over time.  Based on those numbers, it looks like there must be at least 750,000 people in the US alone who think 'Sure, that's probably my email address' on a regular basis.
I asked them if it was safe to be running tours during the pandemic. They said, "During the what?"
I average out the spring and fall changes and just set my clocks 39 minutes ahead year-round.
I believe in getting immunity the old-fashioned way: By letting a bat virus take control of my lungs and turn my face into a disgusting plague fountain while my immune system desperately Googles 'how to make spike protein antibodies'.
I believe the truth always lies halfway between the most extreme claims.
I bet he'll keep quiet for a couple weeks and then-- wait, did you nail a piece of scrap wood to my antique table a moment ago?
I bet if I yell at my scared friends I will feel better.
I bet my future kids will read this someday.  DEAR FUTURE KIDS: how did you get internet in the cellar?
I bet she gets you to mow the lawn, doesn't she?
I built a model that combines local case rates and vaccination stats to estimate when it's reasonable to attend various types of party, but I forgot to include anything about where to find them.
I calculate that the electrons in radiation therapy hit you at 99.8% of the speed of light, and the beam used in a 90-second gamma ray therapy session could, if fired with less precision, kill a horse (they did not let me test this).
I call Rule 34 on The Secret House.
I call Rule 34 on Wolfram's Rule 34.
I came here to chew bubblegum and say no more than eighteen words ... and I'm all out of
I can't get any work done because my friend Catherine is sitting on my keyboard.
I can't help myself; now I want to read a bunch of thinkpieces from newspapers in Biff's 1985 arguing over whether the growth of the region into a corporate dystopia was inevitable.
I can't remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express.
I can't speak for your other subjects, but MY motion was as smooth and natural as the framerate allowed.
I can't speak to the paper's scientific merits, but it's really cool how on page 10 you can see that their reference GPS beacon is sensitive enough to pick up continential drift under the detector (interrupted halfway through by an earthquake).
I can't wait until I'm fully vaccinated and can safely send chat messages in all caps again.
I can't wait until this is all over and I can go back to riding my horse through the mall.
I could type this into a solver, which MIGHT help, but would also mean I have to get a lot of parentheses right...
I didn't even know I *had* the Monty Python 'Lumberjack' song.
I didn't even realize they MADE a novelization of "Surf Ninjas." How did you-- Oh my god, it's signed by the author?!
I didn't even realize you could HAVE a data set made up entirely of outliers.
I didn't understand what you meant. I still don't. But I'll figure it out soon!
I do this constantly
I don't care what the research says. Everybody knows you should drink 3,000 glasses of water a day and change your oil every 8 miles.
I don't care whether you win or lose, as long as you have-- ...okay, sorry, I'm being reminded I very much care whether you win or lose. I need you to win, that's very important.
I don't even *want* this package!  Why did I join the stinging insect of the month club, anyway?
I don't know about houseflies, but we definitely caught a lot of fruit flies with our vinegar bowl.  Hooray science!
I don't know what's more telling--the number of pages in the Wikipedia talk page argument over whether the 1/87.0857143 scale is called "HO" or "H0", or the fact that within minutes of first hearing of it I had developed an extremely strong opinion on the issue.
I don't know what's worse -- that there exists broken-hard-drive-sound techno, or that it's not half bad.
I don't know what's worse--the fact that after 15 years of using tar I still can't keep the flags straight, or that after 15 years of technological advancement I'm still mucking with tar flags that were 15 years old when I started.
I don't remember her name at all, but she fell asleep on the floor in front of me.
I don't see how; the C0 block is right there at the beginning.
I don't see why everyone is so hungry for BAD news, but fine, I'll give in to feedback and add a dark mode.
I don't think the Lakeshore Air Crash Museum really belongs under 'Tourist Attractions.' It's not a museum--it's just an area near the Lake Festival Laser Show where a lot of planes have crashed.
I don't trust mantle/core geologists because I suspect that, if they ever get a chance to peel away the Earth's crust, they'll do it in a heartbeat.
I don't understand the things you do, and you therefore may represent an interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual plasma.
I don't understand why anyone would pay full price for a flatbed truck rental when you can buy 'DETOUR' signs online for like $10.
I don't understand why people are so disingenuous!  I just want someone to walk with!
I don't want to talk about it
I dropped a bird and I didn't hear it hit bottom.
I ended up getting my tax return prepared at a local place by a really friendly pretrained neural net named Greg.
I favor approval voting or IRV chiefly because they mean we might get to bring back The Bull Moose party.
I feel bad for Earth 2 and their shadowflies.
I felt so clever when I found a way to game the Fitocracy system by incorporating a set of easy but high-scoring activities into my regular schedule. Took me a bit to realize I'd been tricked into setting up a daily exercise routine.
I figured that now that society has collapsed, I wouldn't need to wear clothes anymore, but apparently that violates some weird rule of quantum gravity.
I find so much fun in language.
I find that when someone's taking time to do something right in the present, they're a perfectionist with no ability to prioritize, whereas when someone took time to do something right in the past, they're a master artisan of great foresight.
I firmly believe that nothing can go wrong on a project if you're wearing one of those wrist things.
I first saw this problem on the Google Labs Aptitude Test.  A professor and I filled a blackboard without getting anywhere.  Have fun.
I found a copy of The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, but the idea of reading it didn't spark joy, so I gave it away.
I found a counterexample to the claim that all things must someday die, but I don't know how to show it to anyone.
I found an old tape of this episode in my family's closet.  Check the news section of the forums to see the clip!
I get that there are security reasons for the schedule, but this is like the ONE problem we have where the right answer is both easy and straightforward. If we can't figure it out, maybe we should just give up and just replace all the portraits on the bills with that weird pyramid eye thing.
I got banned from the county fair for handing out Helium-2 balloons. Apparently the instant massive plasma explosions violated some local ordinance or something.
I got lost and wandered into the world's creepiest cemetery, where the headstones just had names and star ratings. Freaked me out. When I got home I tried to leave the cemetery a bad review on Yelp, but as my hand hovered over the 'one star' button I felt this distant chill ...
I got to check off 'Make something called xkcd' early.
I guess I need to apologize to my parents, friends, and the staff at Chuck E. Cheese's for all the times I called the cops on them.
I guess I should be signing stuff, but I've never been sure what to sign. Maybe if I post my private key, I can crowdsource my decisions about what to sign.
I guess if she accepted irrational realities, she'd hardly be my fantasy.
I guess it's a saying from the Old Country.
I guess it's also the right setting for pictures of the Moon at night.
I guess the engineers who built my dishwasher MIGHT have some insight into how to load it, but instead of reading the booklet they gave me, it seems easier to experiment for years and then get in arguments so heated that I get banned from Quora.
I had a hard time with Ayn Rand because I found myself enthusiastically agreeing with the first 90% of every sentence, but getting lost at 'therefore, be a huge asshole to everyone.'
I had a really hard time not writing '... profit!'
I had fun visiting the museum at Dover Air Force Base, unless they don't have a museum, in which case I've never been to Delaware in my life.
I had some important research to do on proposed interstellar space missions, basketball statistics, canceled skyscrapers, and every article linked from "Women in warfare and the military in the 19th century."
I hate being the slowest guy in the lab.
I hate how many times you have to press it to get to the system normal people use, degrees Rømer.
I hate how the media only ever uses the first part of this quote, stripping it of its important context.
I hate when I read something like '... tension among the BASE jumpers nearly led to wingsuit combat ...', and I get excited because 'wingsuit combat' is underlined, only to find that it's just separate links to the 'wingsuit' and 'combat' articles.
I hate when people take photos of their meal instead of eating it, because there's nothing I love more than the sound of other people chewing.
I have a bunch of things open right now.
I have a thing for corrupt women.
I have accidentally watered virtually every person and object in Pelican Town.
I have never been as self-conscious about my handwriting as when I was inking in the caption for this comic.
I have never been lied to by data in a .txt file which has been hand-aligned.
I have never been totally satisfied by the explanations for why e to the ix gives a sinusoidal wave.
I have never seen a work of fiction so perfectly capture the out-of-nowhere shock of discovering that you've just bricked something important because you didn't pay enough attention to a loose wire.
I have nothing to apologize for.
I have so many plans. It would incorporate a Galton board, a Ranque-Hilsch marble vortex tube, and a compartment lined with pinball bouncers with a camera-and-servo Maxwell's Demon that separated the balls into fast and slow sides.
I have this weird thing where if I don't drink enough water, I start feeling bad and then die of dehydration.
I haven't had the patience for RPGs in a long time.
I hear Steven Levitt is writing a book analyzing A.J. Jacobs' quest to spend a year reading everything Malcolm Gladwell ever wrote. The audiobook will be narrated by Robert Krulwich of Radiolab.
I hear in some places, you need one form of ID to buy a gun, but two to pay for it by check. It's interesting who has what incentives to care about what mistakes.
I hear many of you finally have smooth Flash support, but me and my Intel card are still waiting on a kernel patch somewhere in the pipeline before we can watch Jon Stewart smoothly.
I hear my brother Ricky won his school's egg drop by leaving the egg inside the hen.
I hear once you've worked there for 256 days they teach you the secret of levitation.
I hear that there are actual lyrics later on in Land of 1,000 Dances, but other than the occasional 'I said,' I've never listened long enough to hear any of them.
I hear that these days Bill Watterson is happy just painting in the Ohio woods with his father and doesn't get any mail or talk to anyone.
I hear this is an option in the latest Ubuntu release.
I heard the general anesthesia drugs can cause amnesia, so when I woke up mid-extraction I started taking notes on my hand so I'd remember things later. I managed 'AWAKE BUT EVERYTHING OK' before the dental assistant managed to find and confiscate all my pens.
I heard they might make the wild card game, which would be cool. Do you know when that is? I have a wedding next weekend, but if it's after that we could try to go!
I honestly didn't think you could even USE emoji in variable names. Or that there were so many different crying ones.
I hope no automatic doors I know read this.  I would be so embarrassed.
I hope that somewhere in the world, "Panamax" is the last option on a "size" drop-down menu on a sex toy site.
I hope we can stop them
I just Googled 'roomba sojourner mod' and was sorely disappointed. Be the change, I guess!
I just call all of them 'synecdoche'.
I just came from The Martian, and I just have to say: Forget BB-8; I want a pet Sojourner! It's always been the cutest of our Mars rovers.
I just can't wait for the Better Homes and Gardens list of helpful tips for household reuse of sixteen-inch acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene phalluses.
I just caught myself idly trying to work out what that resistor mass would actually be, and realized I had self-nerd-sniped.
I just learned about the Slide Mountain Ocean, which I like because it's three nouns that sound like they can't possibly all refer to the same thing.
I just noticed CVS has started stocking homeopathic pills on the same shelves with--and labeled similarly to--their actual medicine. Telling someone who trusts you that you're giving them medicine, when you know you’re not, because you want their money, isn’t just lying--it’s like an example you’d make up if you had to illustrate for a child why lying is wrong.
I just read a pop-science book by a respected author. One chapter, and much of the thesis, was based around wildly inaccurate data which traced back to ... Wikipedia. To encourage people to be on their toes, I'm not going to say what book or author.
I just spent 20 minutes deciding whether to start an email with 'Hi' or 'Hey', so I think it transferred correctly.
I just think lane markers should follow the local magnetic declination.
I just want to give him a hug or something.
I just want to stay up long enough to watch the ball drop into the hole number 2018.
I keep first aid kits in those emergency lockers. Sure, it's expensive to have them installed in the wall, but at least for those ones there's no need to pay extra for safety glass.
I know a lot of people hate these, but I prefer them to touchpads.
I know hand dryers have their problems, but I think for fun we should keep egging Dyson on and see if we can get them to make one where the airflow breaks the speed of sound.
I know it seems overwhelming, but don't worry; I'm sure most of them have only a few stars, and probably no planets.
I know it seems unpleasant, but of the two ways we typically transfer them, I promise this is the one you want.
I know the etiquette is controversial, but I think it's rude when the person in front of me reclines their seat into the bell of my trumpet.
I know they said this change is permanent, but surely when they hear how much we're complaining someone will find a way to change things back.
I laugh at the software as if I'm 100% confident that it's 2019.
I lead a small but extraordinarily persuasive religion whose only members are door-to-door proselytizers from other faiths.
I learned from Achewood that since this poem is in ballad meter, it can be sung to the tune of Gilligan's Island.  Since then, try as I might, I haven't ONCE been able to read it normally.
I like the idea of cartograms (distorted population maps), but I feel like in practice they often end up being the worst of both worlds—not great for showing geography OR counting people. And on top of that, they have all the problems of a chloro... chorophl... chloropet... map with areas colored in.
I like to think that somewhere out there, there's someone whose personal quest is lobbying TV providers to add an option to switch their on-screen keyboards to Dvorak.
I like trying to make it as hard as possible. "I'd love to meet up, maybe in a few days? Next week is looking pretty empty. *witchcraft"
I liked the idea, suggested by h00k on bash.org, of a Twitter bot that messages prominent politicians to tell them when they've unnecessarily used sms-speak abbreviations despite having plenty of characters left.
I literally could care less.
I live on a torn-bag-of-potato-chips-where-the-tear-is-rapidly-growing fault, which is terrifying.
I looked at some of the data dumps from vulnerable sites, and it was ... bad. I saw emails, passwords, password hints. SSL keys and session cookies. Important servers brimming with visitor IPs. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion, c-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. I should probably patch OpenSSL.
I looked up "insanity" in like 10 different dictionaries and none of them said anything like that. Neither did the DSM-4. But I'll keep looking. Maybe it's in the DSM-5!
I love Brussels Sprouts Mandela Effect; I saw them open for Correct Horse Battery Staple.
I love Eileen / and want you to love her / When you're around / I'm one floor above her / If you could see / just how much I adore her / Oh, that pretty red dress / I'd do anything for her /  (Too ra loo ra too ra loo rye ayy)
I love how Google handles dimensional analysis.  Stats are ballpark and vary wildly by time of day and whether your mom is in town.
I love the idea here, though of course it's not a great-quality drawing or scan.
I love the title-text!
I make tools for managing job-hunting sites for people who make tools for managing job-hunting sites for people who make tools for ...
I may be the kind of person who wastes a year implementing a Turing-complete computer in Dwarf Fortress, but that makes you the kind of person who wastes ten more getting that computer to run Minecraft.
I may have also tossed one of a pair of teleportation rings into the ocean, with interesting results.
I mean, I can barely hear myself complaining about Battlestar Galactica.
I mean, if it's that easy to get a theorem named for you ... "a straight line that passes through the center of a coplanar circle always divides the circle into two equal halves." Can I have that one? Wait, can I auction off the naming rights? It can be the Red Bull Theorem or the Quicken Loans Theorem, depending who wants it more.
I mean, it wasn't exactly MY thesis. When the FAA came to shut down our observatory for using the telescope mirror to shine light at airplanes, I took a thesis and a bunch of doctorates from the supply cabinet on my way out.
I mean, it's been almost twenty years. Now, it's possible you're simply embedding Windows directory paths in your URIs, but in that case you need more than just a short lecture.
I mean, it's not like we could just demand to see the code that's governing our lives. What right do we have to poke around in Facebook's private affairs like that?
I mean, it's pretty, but it doesn't really affect us beyond that. Except that half the nights aren't really dark, and once or twice a day it makes the oceans flood the coasts.
I mean, seriously, NOWHERE? For starters, there are like a thousand species of dinosaur.
I mean, the black-and-white stuff was running backward, but it hardly mattered to the story.
I mean, we already live in a world of flying robots killing people. I don't worry about how powerful the machines are, I worry about who the machines give power to.
I mean, what's more likely -- that I have uncovered fundamental flaws in this field that no one in it has ever thought about, or that I need to read a little more?  Hint: it's the one that involves less work.
I need a lawn, so I can yell at kids to stay off it.
I need an extension for my research project because I spent all month trying to figure out whether learning Dvorak would help me type it faster.
I never got around to seeing that movie about the battle (of Midway).
I never trust anyone who's more excited about success than about doing the thing they want to be successful at.
I never understood why someone would expect me to accept their rules right after they'd punched me.  I'm sure it's all very symbolic or something.
I occasionally do this with mile markers on the highway.
I once asked an NSA guy whether they'd broken RSA.  And I know I can trust him, because I asked if he was lying to me and he said no.
I once got to second base with a basketball player.  She was so confused.
I once made an anniversary card for my then-girlfriend with this layout.
I once worked on a friend's dad's computer. He had the hard drive divided into six partitions, C: through J:, with a 'Documents' directory tree on each one. Each new file appeared to be saved to a partition at random. I knew enough not to ask.
I plugged in this lamp and my dog went rigid, spoke a sentence of perfect Akkadian, and then was hurled sideways through the picture window. Even worse, it's one of those lamps where the switch is on the cord.
I pray GunPistolMan never learns the word 'sheeple'.
I pronounce epitome "EPPY-tome", but EpiPen "uh-PIE-pen".
I pronounce the 'u' in 'pronunciation' like in 'putting' but the 'ou' in 'pronounce' like in 'wound'.
I read in this one article that the breaking of electroweak symmetry is the reason we have SOULS. This guy with a degree said so!
I really shouldn't abuse that power so heavily.
I recently had someone ask me to go get a computer and turn it on so I could restart it. He refused to move further in the script until I said I had done that.
I recently learned something that solved a mystery that had bugged me since childhood--why, when I looked at an analog clock, the hand would sometimes seem to take a couple seconds to start ticking. Google "stopped clock illusion".
I recognize that chocolate is its own thing on which reasonable people may differ. Everything else here is objective fact.
I remember the exact moment in my childhood when I realized, while reading a flyer, that nobody would ever spend money solely to tell me they wanted to give me something for nothing. It's a much more vivid memory than the (related) parental Santa talk.
I remember trying to log in to the original Command and Conquer servers a year or two back and feeling like I was knocking on the boarded-up gates of a ghost town. 
I run a business selling rural internet access. My infrastructure consists of a bunch of Verizon wifi hotspots that I sign up for and then cancel at the end of the 14-day return period.
I searched my .bash_history for the line with the highest ratio of special characters to regular alphanumeric characters, and the winner was: cat out.txt | grep -o "[[(].*[])][^)]]*$" ... I have no memory of this and no idea what I was trying to do, but I sure hope it worked.
I secretly, deep in my guilty heart, like Papyrus and don't care if it's overused. [Cue hate mail in beautifully-kerned Helvetica.]
I should make a list of all the things I could be trying to optimize, prioritized by ... well, I guess there are a few different variables I could use. I'll create a spreadsheet ...
I sort of wish my texting app showed the percentage next to each person, but also sort of don't want to know.
I spent a long time thinking about how to design a system for long-term organization and storage of subject-specific informational resources without needing ongoing work from the experts who created them, only to realized I'd just reinvented libraries.
I spent more time trying to get an audible.com audio book playing than it took to listen to the book.  I have lost every other piece of DRM-locked music I have paid for.
I started off with countless problems. But now I know, thanks to COUNT(), that I have "#REF! ERROR: Circular dependency detected" problems.
I started to do the tables for more famous people but it got really depressing and morbid and I had to go outside.  Hat guy wins again.
I still don't understand why the Sun paid the extra money for Transitions lenses.
I still think the Cold Stone Creamery partnership was a good idea, but I should have asked before doing the first market trials during the cryogenic mirror tests.
I still wish it were true.
I suppose that's more accurately a hare dryer.
I sympathize with the TPP protagonist because I, too, have progressed through a surprising number of stages of life despite spending entire days stuck against simple obstacles.
I take it Narnia doesn't have Cinnabons? Because if you can magic up a plate of those, I'll betray whoever.
I take the view that "open-faced sandwiches" are not sandwiches, but all other physical objects are.
I tell my children 'it's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game.' I'm trying to take the edge off their competitive drive to ensure that I can always beat them.
I think I could spend hours just stepping on and off of conveyor belts moving at various speeds.
I think I see a Mandelbrot set! No, that's just blood splatters. Golly.
I think Voyager 1 would be just past the event horizon, but slightly less than halfway to the bright ring.
I think about self-reference a lot.  Example: this comment.
I think it's the sheep zapping the cactus and not vice-versa
I think of myself as the David Attenborough of factory mailing equipment.
I think the IETF hit the right balance with the 128 bits thing. We can fit MAC addresses in a /64 subnet, and the nanobots will only be able to devour half the planet.
I think you could get up to about 11:59:57 before you'd have trouble swallowing the chocolates fast enough. At that point, you'd need some kind of a liquify-and-chug apparatus to get up over the 11:59:59 barrier. Anyway, Merry Christmas!
I think you mean 'GNU Info Override'.
I thought of another bad opinion! I couldn't find anyone who expressed it specifically, but still, the fact that I can so easily imagine it is infuriating! I'm gonna tell everyone about it!
I told her I'd take her address off the packaging if she'd stop submitting anonymous food safety complaints about my bakery to the health department, but she sent me a note that said NO DEAL along with an extra large batch of cookies.
I tried converting the prices into pizzas, to put it in more familiar terms, and it just became a hard-to-think-about number of pizzas.
I tried oxidizing them, but your bank uses some really weird paper and it wouldn't light.
I tried to send a message back, but I accidentally hit 'reply all' and now the ocean is clogged with message bottles.
I tried to train an AI to repair my Python environment but it kept giving up and deleting itself.
I understand large sample sizes are key to a low standard error of the mean, but the entire sophomore class?
I understand modern autogyros are much more stable, so I've probably angered the autogyro people by impugning their safety. Once they finish building the autogyros they've been working on in their garages for 10 years, they'll come after me.
I understand you and your team worked hard on this, but when we said to make it more realistic, we meant the graphics.
I used to do this all the time.
I usually respond to someone else doing something good by figuring out a reason that they're not really as good as they seem. But I've been realizing lately that there's an easier way to handle these situations, and it involves zero internet arguments.
I vaguely and irrationally resent how useful WebPlotDigitizer is.
I wanna hold your hand so I don't fall out of your gyrocopter.
I want this engraved on my tombstone like the Epitaph of Stevinus.
I want to sell apples but I'm still working on getting the machine to do the cutting and grafting.
I wanted us to try finding an approximate numeric solution, but noooo.
I was actually a little relieved when I learned that JPEG2000 was used in the DCI digital cinema standard. I was feeling so bad for it!
I was almost fired from a job driving the hearse in funeral processions, but then the funeral home realized how much business I was creating for them.
I was banned from the airliners.net photography forum by concerned moderators after the end of my lens started brushing against planes as they flew by.
I was eventually kicked out of my architectural engineering program because I wouldn't stop referring to HVAC as "the fandom."
I was fired by the National Weather Service five minutes after they hired me for going into their code base and renaming all the tornado warnings to "tornado spoiler alerts."
I was going to be a scientist, but that seems silly now. Magical worlds exist. I've learned a huge truth about our place in the universe. I'm supposed to care about college? I mean, FUCK.
I was going to get you an alarm clock that occasionally goes off randomly in the middle of the night, but you can ignore it and go back to sleep and it's fine.
I was going to record an album with that cover under the name "PINK FTFY", so it'd come after them on the store CD rack. But at this point music stores are just rooms where CDs are set out to age before they're thrown away, so probably nobody would see it.
I was just disassembling it over the course of five hours so it would fit in the trash more efficiently.
I was really impressed by the accuracy of some of the report's predictions about fossil fuel consumption. Then I realized, oh, right, of course.
I was sent here to stop the robot that was sent here to protect the human who was sent here to protect the human who was sent here to destroy the robot that was sent here to vacuum the floor.
I was sure he was just getting revenge, but then he did the same thing to Carrie Underwood. Then he mailed me a scone. I think I'm giving up dating.
I was there, dude.
I was thinking of observing stars to verify Einstein's theory of relativity again, but I gotta say, that thing is looking pretty solid at this point.
I was, at least at the start of this disastrous game night, your friend.
I wasn't a big fan of 3 or Salvation, so I'm trying to resist getting my hopes up too much for Dark Fate, but it's hard. I'm just a sucker for humans and robots traveling through time to try to drive trucks into each other, apparently.
I watched from a beautiful nature reserve in central Missouri, and it was--without exaggeration--the coolest thing I've ever seen.
I went to a dinner where there was a full 10 minutes of Holy Grail quotes exchanged, with no context, in lieu of conversation.  It depressed me badly.
I will vote, no questions asked, for any candidate who describes themselves as 'more of a deficit sugar glider.'
I wish I knew how to quit this so I wouldn't have to quit you.
I wish I'd missed you then so I wouldn't be missing you now
I woke up to find that I had scrawled the last line of this sleepily on a sheet of paper on my desk.  I shouldn't have listened to the 70's hit marathon on the way home from work the night before.
I won't eat invertebrates, because I can fight a skeleton, but I have no idea what kind of spooky warrior a squid leaves behind.
I wonder how hard it would be to ride an electric scooter in a hamster ball.
I wonder how often Patrick Stewart has Darmok flashbacks when talking to Star Trek fans.
I wonder if I still have time to go shoot a short film with Kevin Bacon.
I wonder if that friendly lady ever fixed the problem she was having with her headset.
I wonder what 2008 meme will go bizarrely mainstream in 2009 like Rickrolling did 2007-2008.  I Accidentally <noun>?  Yo dawg?  Place your bets now!
I wonder what I was dreaming to prompt that.  I hope it wasn't the Richard Stallman Cirque de Soleil thing again.
I wonder what percentage of not-obviously-busy people on the street would say yes to kite-flying with a stranger.  This looks like a job for Science!
I wonder what the trendy adults in 2019 who are too cool for Pokemon will be into. Probably Digimon!
I wonder what year I'll discard the last weird food item that I bought online in early 2020.
I would be honored, but I know I don't belong in your network. The person you invited was someone who had not yet inflicted this two-year ordeal upon you. I'm no longer that person.
I would describe my personal alignment as "lawful heterozygous silty liquid."
I would never stoop to vandalism, but I'm not above discreetly deleting the occasional 'this article contains excessive amounts of detail' tag.
I would say time is definitely one of my top three favorite dimensions.
I would subscribe to a Twitter feed that supplied you with one reasonable sports opinion per day, like 'The Red Sox can't make the playoffs (championship games), but in last night's game their win seriously damaged the chances of the Yankees (longstanding rival team).'
I would take 'kibibyte' more seriously if it didn't sound so much like 'Kibbles N Bits'.
I wrote 20 short programs in Python yesterday.  It was wonderful.  Perl, I'm leaving you.
I'M PLUGGING IN MY PHONE BUT THE BATTERY ON THE SCREEN ISN'T CHARGING
I'M SORRY, FROM YOUR YEARS OF CONDESCENDING TOWARD THE 'SQUISHY SCIENCES', I ASSUMED YOU'D BE A LITTLE HARDER.
I'd like 0.4608 apples, please.
I'd like to find a corpus of writing from children in a non-self-selected sample (e.g. handwritten letters to the president from everyone in the same teacher's 7th grade class every year)--and score the kids today versus the kids 20 years ago on various objective measures of writing quality. I've heard the idea that exposure to all this amateur peer practice is hurting us, but I'd bet on the generation that conducts the bulk of their social lives via the written word over the generation that occasionally wrote book reports and letters to grandma once a year, any day.
I'd like to see more damage assessments for hurricanes hitting New York and flooding Manhattan -- something like the 1938 Long Island Express, but aimed a bit more to the west.  It's just a matter of time.
I'd press on them to try to unstick them, but I can't reach.  Can we try cycling day and night really fast?
I'd traverse it myself, but it's singly linked, so I'm worried that I won't be able to find my way back to 2021.
I'll be honest--the 1950s were a rough time for cycling.
I'll concede ergonomics anecdotally, but none of the studies of Dvorak were at all rigorous (the most-cited Navy study was overseen by Dvorak himself).  And the 'slow typists down' thing is a myth.  Also EMACS RULES VI DROOLS WOOOOOOO!
I'll never forget you--at least, the parts of you that were important red flags.
I'll never install a smart home smoke detector. It's not that I don't trust the software--it's that all software eventually becomes email, and I know how I am with email.
I'll take mine on the rocks, no ice.
I'm SO glad I escaped. They almost had me caught in their weird ... thing.
I'm a big fan of Kurt Halsey
I'm a solipsistic conspiracy theorist. I'm sure I must be up to something, and I will not stop until I find out what.
I'm actually not sure if Vader and the Emperor count as a household or if Vader lives in that weird black egg thing or what.
I'm always disappointed when 'Anamorphic Widescreen' doesn't refer to a widescreen Animorphs movie.
I'm always installing tons of weird experimental keyboards because it serves as a good reminder that nothing I was going to type was really worth the trouble.
I'm always so happy that I successfully navigated the introduction that I completely forget to pay attention to the name the other person told me.
I'm as surprised as you!
I'm as surprised as you!  I didn't think it was possible.
I'm compromising by picking a weird hill to lie on.
I'm currently in the I Have Cheese phase of this cycle.
I'm entering my 24th year of spending eight hours a day firing the Duck Hunt gun at the flying toasters. I'm sure I'll hit one soon.
I'm excited about the proposal to add a "brontosaurus" emoji codepoint because it has the potential to bring together a half-dozen different groups of pedantic people into a single glorious internet argument.
I'm glad modern car washes use synthetic baleen, instead of harvesting it from whales like 1800s car washes did.
I'm glad this is so much fun because I'm not sure how we're getting down.
I'm glad to hear they're finally redefining the meter to be exactly three feet.
I'm going to change the sign so the pole is horizontal and the sign is mounted on the front like a plunger, so I can carry it around like a lance to gently push people back if they try to approach.
I'm going to drive this Netherlands joke so far into the ground they'll have to build levees around it to keep the sea out.
I'm going to tell the manufacturer that their business practices are ADMIRABLE and ETHICAL and their developers are ATTRACTIVE and I'm going to report them to the FCC for their IMPECCABLE VIRTUE.
I'm gonna call the cops and get Chad arrested for theft, then move all my stuff to the house across the street. Hopefully the owners there are more responsible.
I'm gonna have to add something to the strum bar so it makes a clicky sound like the old controllers.  I'm so used to the feedback; the silence throws me off.
I'm happy with my Kindle 2 so far, but if they cut off the free Wikipedia browsing, I plan to show up drunk on Jeff Bezos's lawn and refuse to leave.
I'm hoping 2022 is relatively normal because I don't know what symbol comes after the asterisk and the dagger.
I'm in talks with Netflix to produce an alternate-universe crime drama about the world where sliced bread was never re-legalized, but it's going slowly because they keep changing their phone numbers and the door lock codes at their headquarters.
I'm inside your head and I hate it. Please let me out.
I'm just trying to explain, please don't be jealous!  Man, why are all my relationships ruined by early 90's rappers?
I'm just worried that we'll all leave and you won't get to come along!
I'm leaning toward fifteen. There are a lot of them.
I'm leaving you for your twin.  He's more mature than you by now.
I'm like a prisoner in Plato's Cave, seeing only the shade you throw on the wall.
I'm like a vampire, except I'm not crossing that threshold even if you invite me.
I'm like the Terminator, except with love!
I'm looking forward to having to worry a lot less about covid, but wouldn't mind if we worried a little more about giving each other colds. Colds are bad!
I'm looking to virally monetize your eyeballs by selling them for transplants.
I'm normally a pretty frugal person, but I still compulsively buy any R/C aircraft that's less than $30.  In the last few years, this has become a problem.
I'm not a lawyer, but I believe zones like this are technically considered the high seas, so if you cut a pizza into a spiral there you could be charged with pieracy under marinaritime law.
I'm not listening to you.  I mean, what does a SQUIRREL know about mental health?
I'm not saying it's all bad, but that movie has not aged as well as my teenage self in 2000 was confident it would.
I'm not sure if this is actually true
I'm not sure if you can get Epcot, but my friend just got LegoLand. He guessed California but it was the one in Denmark. Meanwhile, I'm rapidly becoming a connoisseur of unmarked dirt roads over flat, barren landscapes.
I'm not totally locked into my routine—twice a year, I take a break to change the batteries in my smoke detectors.
I'm not very good at meeting people.
I'm on the USPS No Fly List
I'm one of the few Instagram users who connects solely through the Unix 'talk' gateway.
I'm only willing to visit placid lakes, salt flats, and painting exhibits until the world's 3D technology improves.
I'm pretty sure I've logged more hours in Google Maps over the past decade than in any game.
I'm proud to announce that as of this year I've become a world-class expert at chewing.
I'm reading a goddamn book, thank you very much.
I'm really worried Christopher Nolan will kill a man dressed like a bat in his next movie. (The man will be dressed like a bat, I mean. Christopher Nolan won't be, probably.)
I'm rubber. You're rubber. We contemplate the reality of our existence in mute, vulcanized horror.
I'm so bad at carrying a tune, those 'find a song by humming its melody' websites throw an HTTP 406 error as soon as I start to hum.
I'm so glad NASA let you take your phone to Mars!
I'm sorry, but the author of this Facebook comment clearly believes you were.
I'm staring at the "doctor" section, and I can't help but feel like I've forgotten someone.
I'm still waiting for a chance to use 'I have to see a man about a horse'.
I'm sure a discussion of the reason for the disappearance of adventure games in favor of RPGs would be fascinating
I'm sure they're a harmful tool of the cosmetics-industrial complex and all, but my goodness do those strips ever work to pull gunk out of your pores. I was shocked, disgusted, and vaguely fascinated by the result.
I'm sure you can find some suitable worldbuilding material if you scavenge through the archives.
I'm teaching every 8-year-old relative to say this, and every 14-year-old to do the same thing with Toy Story.  Also, Pokemon hit the US over a decade ago and kids born after Aladdin came out will turn 18 next year.
I'm the Philosopher until someone hands me a burrito.
I'm the proud parent of an honor student, and the person driving me is proud, too!
I'm trying to be healthier, so after I eat this brick of cheese, I'll have a spoonful of grease-soaked vegetables.
I'm trying to build character but Eclipse is really confusing.
I'm trying to get the page locked because some jerk keeps adding "Yachts".
I'm trying to prove that mathematics forms a meta-abelian group, which would finally confirm my suspicions that algebraic geometry and geometric algebra are the same thing.
I'm waiting for the day when, if you tell someone 'I'm from the internet', instead of laughing they just ask 'oh, what part?'
I'm working on a car capable of evaluating arbitrarily complex boolean expressions on "honk if [...]" bumper stickers and responding accordingly.
I'm working on assembling a combination declinometer, sclerometer, viscometer, aleurometer, stalagmometer, and hypsometer. I'm making good progress according to my ometerometer, a device which shows the rate at which I'm acquiring measurement devices.
I'm working to bring about a superintelligent AI that will eternally torment everyone who failed to make fun of the Roko's Basilisk people.
I've always wondered whether you could drink slowly enough, and eliminate fast enough, that you just sort of peed continuously. But I'm afraid to try because I worry someone might call while I'm doing it and ask what I'm up to, and I won't be able to think of a lie.
I've been sneaking out at night and installing lamps on the underside of every photovoltaic panel I can find. Sure, there are upwards of 80% losses, but I prefer to think of them as nearly 20% gains.
I've been trying for a couple years now but I haven't been able to come up with a name dumber than 'Renesmee'.
I've been working my way through this 1950s podcast by someone named John Tolkien called 'Lord of the Rings'--it's a deep dive into this fictional world he created. Good stuff, really bingeable!
I've been working on chocolate bar annealing techniques to try to produce the perfect laser s'more. Maybe don't mention that on the grant application though.
I've decided to score all my conversations using chess win-loss notation. (??)
I've developed a more logical set of rules but the people on the chess community have a bunch of stupid emotional biases and won't reply to my posts.
I've developed a novel propulsion system powered by loss of precision in unit conversion.
I've got the Craigslist post ready to go! I wasn't sure what category it should go in, so I listed it as property and put that it has 'good sun exposure.'
I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the MIT computer science program permanently.
I've lived in the present for my whole life and I'm not about to move now.
I've looked at clouds from both sides now.
I've looked into this, and I can't figure out a way to do it cheaply.  And I guess it wouldn't be sanitary.
I've looked through a few annotated versions of classic books, and it's shocking how much of what's in there is basically pop-culture references totally lost on us now.
I've never been that big of a hug person, but it turns out I'm not quite this small of a hug person either.
I've seen advertisers put their URLs on chalkboards, encircled with a DNE.  They went unerased for months.  If you see this, feel free to replace the URL with xkcd.com.
IATA stands for International AirporT Abbreviation.
INSIDE ELON MUSK'S NEW ATOMIC CAT
ISO 8601 was published on 06/05/88 and most recently amended on 12/01/04.
ISSUE: If we wait long enough, the Earth will eventually be consumed by the Sun. WORKAROUND: None.
IT'S ALL REAL
If Google Maps stops letting you navigate to (Clay County District) A in West Virginia, you can try Jump, OH -> Ina, IL -> Big Hole, TX.
If I click 'no', I've probably given up on everything, so don't bother taking me to the page I was trying to go to. Just drop me on the homepage. Thanks.
If I developed a hue-shifting metamaterial, I would photobomb people's Instagram pics with a sheet of material that precisely undid the filter they were using.
If I get a Wii, it will be the first game console I've owned.
If I really focus, I can distinguish between John Steinbeck and John Updike, or between Gore Vidal and Vidal Sassoon, but not both at once.
If I wait a while, it's not so bad, because then it's just shaped like me, plus some pipes and tanks and probably eventually all of Earth's oceans.
If I were trapped on a desert island, and could have an unlimited supply of any one type of apple, I'd be like, "How did this situation happen?"
If I'm not going to upgrade to a powered one, I should at LEAST stop leaving the door open so often.
If I'm such a god, why isn't Maru *my* cat?
If a materials scientist gives you a present, always ask whether regifting will incur any requirements for Federal paperwork.
If a wild bun is sighted, a nice gesture of respect is to send a 'BUN ALERT' message to friends and family, with photographs documenting the bun's location and rank. If no photographs are possible, emoji may be substituted.
If all else fails, use "significant at a p>0.05 level" and hope no one notices.
If an anatomical structure is named for a person, it means they were the only person to have it. Pierre Paul Broca had a special area of his brain that created powerful magnetic fields, enabling him to do 19th century fMRI research.
If androids someday DO dream of electric sheep, don't forget to declare sheepCount as a long int.
If anyone calls you on any weird detail, just say it's from the Jedi Prince book series, which contains so much random incongruous stuff that even most Expanded Universe/Legends fans collectively agreed to forget about it decades ago.
If anyone tries this on you, the best reply is a deadpan "Oh yeah, that's a common potato chip flavor in Canada."
If at first you don't succeed, that's one data point.
If at least one person has a nightmare about being swarmed by hundreds of mouse-sized dromaeosaurids, my work will have been done.
If data fails the Teacher's t test, you can just force it to take the test again until it passes.
If enough people uphill decide to try the rolling strategy, they can make the decision for you.
If history has taught us anything, we can use that information to destroy it.
If it falls below 20% full, my bag turns red and I start to panic.
If it were a two or above I wouldn't be able to answer because it would mean a pause in the screaming.
If it's over water, and you can't get a boat or revise the rules to preserve the makeout, there is no helping you.
If long tooltips / cut off for you / then upgrade from / Firefox 2 / Burma Shave
If most people turn into muderers all of a sudden, we'll need to push out a firmware update or something.
If my country ever picks a new national flag, this is on my shortlist for designs to argue for, but I think in the end I'll go with the green puzzle piece or broken image thumbnail.
If only I had asked 4chan for ideas for what I should do to prevent this!
If only somebody had warned them that the world would roll them like this.
If only we'd chosen 1944-12-02 08:45:52 as the Unix epoch, we could've combined two doomsday scenarios into one and added a really boring scene to that Roland Emmerich movie.
If our current civilization lasts another 8,000 years, it's probably fair to assume the Long Now Foundation got things right, and at some point we started listening to them and switched to five-digit years.
If physics had a mafia, I'm pretty sure the BICEP2 mess would have ended in bloodshed.
If replacing all the '3's doesn't fix your code, remove the 4s, too, with 'ceiling(pi) / floor(pi) * pi * r^floor(pi)'. Mmm, floor pie.
If she'd lived in Flagstaff (elevation 6,903 feet), Cruella de Vil would only have needed 89 dalmatians for her coat.
If so great a deductive mind as Arthur Conan Doyle can be fooled by the Cottingley Deepfakes, what chance do we mortals have? Soon our very reality will be dictated by the whims of Frances (9) and Elsie (16).
If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything.
If that fails, just multiply every number by a thousand. 'The 2nd St speed limit should be set at 25,000 mph, which would likely have prevented 1,000 of the intersection's 3,000 serious accidents last month.'
If that's too easy, you could try joining Tautology Club, which meets on the date of the Tautology Club meeting.
If the breaking news is about an event at a hospital or a lab, move it all the way over to the right.
If the celestial sphere were mapped to the Earth's surface, astronomy would get a LOT easier; you'd just need a magnifying glass.
If the dysentery graph looks historically inaccurate it's because I got all my data from Oregon Trail.
If the first audio they downlink is from the descent, we probably won't be able to hear anything over the sound of the rover screaming.
If the flyers don't work, we'll switch to the LEAST subtle method of informing a town of the existence of a trebuchet club.
If there's no dome, how do you explain the irregularities the board discovered in the zoning permits issued in that area!?
If they're getting valuable enough stuff from you, at least the organized crime folks have an incentive to issue regular updates to keep the appliance working after the manufacturer discontinues support.
If they're going to make people ride bikes and scooters in traffic, then it should at LEAST be legal to do the Snow Crash thing where you use a hook-shot-style harpoon to catch free rides from cars.
If things are too quiet, try asking a couple of friends whether "a couple" should always mean "two". As with the question of how many spaces should go after a period, it can turn acrimonious surprisingly fast unless all three of them agree.
If this were SMBC, the alt-text drawing thingy would be a giraffe hooker fluttering her eyelashes.
If used with software that could keep up, a scroll wheel mapped to send a stream of 'undo' and 'redo' events could be kind of cool.
If we can destroy enough of the lights in our region, we may see more comets, but that's a risk we'll have to take.
If we find one of those tire dumps, the next time he tries to get his truck back we can just retreat and let him have it.
If we get the doors open and plug up the dam on the Sirannon so the water rises a little, the pool will start draining into Moria. How do you think the Watcher would fare against a drenched Balrog?
If you Huffman-coded all the 'random' things everyone on the internet has said over the years, you'd wind up with, like, 30 or 40 bytes *tops*.
If you actually do this, what really happens is Douglas Hofstadter appears and talks to you for eight hours about strange loops.
If you ask "why are leaves green?" the usual answer is "because they're full of chlorophyll, and chlorophyll is green," even though "why does chlorophyll scatter green light?" is a great question too.
If you ask it to please turn off that feature, it apologizes a whole bunch and promises to try to be quieter, then switches to a slightly lower-volume version of the clip with "sorry!" after the louder sounds.
If you call my regular number, it just goes to my pager.
If you can manage to choose u and v such that u = v = x, then the answer is just (1/2)x^2, which is easy to remember. Oh, and add a '+C' or you'll get yelled at.
If you can't get your graphing tool to do the shading, just add some clip art of cosmologists discussing the unusual curvature of space in the area.
If you click on the post, it takes you to search results for the note on various online music stores.
If you close an account while it's still friends with people, it contributes to database linkage accumulation slowdown, which is a major looming problem for web infrastructure and definitely not a thing I just made up.

If you encounter a hex bolt, but you only brought screwdrivers, you can try sandwiching the head of the bolt between two parallel screwdriver shafts, squeezing the screwdrivers together with a hand at either end, then twisting. It doesn't work and it's a great way to hurt yourself, but you can try it!
If you ever hear "Wait, is that Kim Dotcom's new project? I'm really excited about it and already signed up, although I'm a little nervous about whether everyone should hand over control of their medical...", it's time to dig a bunker in your backyard.

If you want to bowl a strike, the optimal place is almost certainly inside a bowling alley, although with a little luck any establishment uphill from one could also work.

If you've never had sex, this is what it feels like. Complete with the brief feeling of satisfaction, followed by ennui, followed by getting bored and trying to make it happen again.

In C, the multiocular O represents the bitwise norxondor gorgonax.
In Connor's second thesis it is stated 'There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.'  Does the routine destroy our creativity or do we lose creativity and fall into the routine?  Anyway, who's up for a road trip!

In fact, draw all your rotational matrices sideways.  Your professors will love it!  And then they'll go home and shrink.
In fact, one of the boxes is full of Staphylococcus. The wrapping paper is coated in E. coli, though, so it's an understandable mistake. You know, we should really stop accepting gifts from that guy.

In lieu of mapping software, I once wrote a Perl program which, given a USB GPS receiver and a destination, printed 'LEFT' 'RIGHT' OR 'STRAIGHT' based on my heading.
In months other than September, the 11th is mentioned substantially less often than any other date. It's been that way since long before 9/11 and I have no idea why.
In my experience, mosquitos and poison ivy are bad, but the very worst itch comes from bites from chiggers (Trombicula alfreddugesi). They're found across the American south and great plains, so the best home remedy is to move to Iceland.
In ordering #5, self-driving cars will happily drive you around, but if you tell them to drive to a car dealership, they just lock the doors and politely ask how long humans take to starve to death.
In protest of SOPA, I'm currently getting totally blacked out.
In retrospect, I shouldn't have used each layer of the OSI model as one of my horcruxes.
In retrospect, it's weird that as a kid I thought completely random outbursts made me seem interesting, given that from an information theory point of view, lexical white noise is just about the opposite of interesting by definition.
In sixty million years aliens will know humans only by a fuzzy clip of a woman in an Axe commercial.
In the 60s, Marvin Minsky assigned a couple of undergrads to spend the summer programming a computer to use a camera to identify objects in a scene. He figured they'd have the problem solved by the end of the summer. Half a century later, we're still working on it.
In the 90s, our variety radio station used the tagline "the best music of the 70s, 80s, and 90s." After 2000, they switched to "the best music of the 80s, 90s, and today." I figured they'd change again in 2010, but it's 2017 and they're still saying "80s, 90s, and today." I hope radio survives long enough for us to find out how they deal with the 2020s.

Interpretations of the Hermeneutic Oath differ.
Ironically, I've been having these same arguments for at least a decade now. I thought we would have moved on by now, but somehow the snide complaints about millennials continue.
Is he ALSO wondering at what point our thoughts diverged, if they even have yet? 'dude, I think he just took your credit card' AM I THE ORIGINAL? HOW DO I TELL?
It IS about physics. It ALL is.
It all came flat-packed in Pandora's Box.
It also brings all the boys, and everything else, to the yard.
It also helps with negotiation. "Look, if it were up to me, *I'd* accept your offer, but my swarm of autonomous killer cells literally can't be reasoned with. It's out of my hands!"
It also occasionally replies with 'Comment of the year', 'Are you for real', and 'I'm taking a screenshot so I can remember this moment forever'.
It also works for anything you teach someone else to do. "Oh yeah, I trained a pair of neural nets, Emily and Kevin, to respond to support tickets."
It beat out 'Clock radio alarm', 'B-flat at 194 decibels', 'That noise from Dumb & Dumber', and 'Recording of a sobbing voice begging you to answer'.
It can be expensive to hire a professional spectroscopist for your wedding, but the quality of the spectra you get is worth it.
It can take a site a while to figure out that there's a problem with their 'report a bug' form.
It can't be very MUCH money ... they apparently can't even afford a sampler.  I mean, with a little remixing, some of this could be kinda good!
It gets worse! You know that wizened old monk with the gypsy wife whose voodoo shop we smash up every day after school?
It has a section on motherboard beep codes that lists, for each beep pattern, a song that syncs up well with it.
It has so many advantages--it preserves Martian life, requires fewer interplanetary launches, and makes it much easier to field-test Mars rovers.
It hurts to be hit there, you know
It looks good, but it needs more postfixins.
It maintains odor levels in a normal familiar range, so if you open the windows and the air gets too fresh, it filters it through some dirty laundry samples to compensate.
It may be a fundamentally empty experience, but holy crap the Droid's 265 ppi screen is amazing.
It may remain in equilibrium for some time, slowly growing, and then suddenly become significantly redder.
It me, your father.
It means shuffling quickly past nuns on the street with ketchup in your palms, pretending you're hiding stigmata.
It only works a few times before you have to capsize the boat in a soap lagoon again.
It says to cut the onions into 1/4" slices, but I'd better correct for length contraction.

It was actually canceled because they just noticed he's been naked under that coat the whole time.  There's a petition on Facebook to get Fox to un-cancel it, and one on Livejournal to get him to take off the coat.
It was also fun when those teenagers tried to egg our house and it insta-cooked the eggs in mid-air.
It was bound to happen eventually. This data theft will enable almost limitless [xkcd.com/792]-style password reuse attacks in the coming weeks. There's only one group that comes out of this looking smart: Everyone who pirated Photoshop.
It was finally destroyed with a nuclear weapon carrying the destructive energy of the Hiroshima bomb.
It was the funniest 6.5 seconds of my life, although as usual like 80% of it was just Tom and Ray's gasping, hacking laughter.
It was their main recruiting poster, hung nearly ten feet up a wall! This means the hackers have LADDER technology! Are we headed for a future where everyone has to pay $50 for one of those locked plexiglass poster covers? More after the break ...
It was tricky.
It wasn't originally constitutionally required, but presidents who served two terms have traditionally followed George Washington's example and gotten false teeth.
It will get within 9 or 10 Sun-diameters of the "bottom" (the Sun's surface) which seems pretty far when you put it that way, but from up here on Earth it's practically all the way down.
It would be pretty unfair to give to someone a blank version of this map as a 'how many states can you name?' quiz. (If you include Alaska and Hawaii, you should swap the Aleutian Islands with the Hawaiian ones.)
It'd be great if some news network started featuring partisan hack talking heads who were all Federalists and Jacksonians, just to see how long it took us to catch on.
It'll be hilarious the first few times this happens.
It's *almost* enough to make me want to redo high school.

It's a myth that you can never cross mountains safely, but be sure you understand how the climatic situation there will affect your parent thunderstorm.
It's actually worst in people who study the Dunning–Kruger effect. We tried to organize a conference on it, but the only people who would agree to give the keynote were random undergrads.
It's always bothered me that you can't cancel out an inverter by putting a second inverter after it.
It's amazing what it does for YouTube comments.

It's been extra bad ever since my GPS got stuck on Phoebe Judge mode.
It's believed to be related to the Stellar Sea Cow.
It's commonly believed that Lorentz contraction makes objects appear flatter along the direction of travel. However, this ignores light travel times. In fact, a fast-moving butt would appear rotated toward the observer but not substantially distorted. Shakira was right.
It's commonly known that too much perspective can be a downer.
It's cool how, when there's a number lots of people are curious about, but which isn't easy to measure, some random guess will get cited everywhere and become the universally quoted value. Unrelatedly, did you know there are 850 trillion waves in the ocean?
It's cool, it's totally ethical--they're all programmed to hunt whichever bird of prey is most numerous at the moment, so they leave the endangered ones alone until near the end.
It's crazy how much my gut opinion of a movie/song is swayed by what other people say, regardless of how I felt coming out of the theater.

It's easier to be an asshole to words than to people.
It's easy to regret your awkward conversations but hard to regret the ones you didn't have.
It's even harder if you're an asshole who pronounces <> brackets.
It's frustrating to calibrate your precautions when there's only one kind of really definitive feedback you can get, you can only get it once, and when you do it's too late.
It's fun to watch browsers fumblingly recapitulate the history of window management. Someday we'll have xmonad as a Firefox extension.
It's going in A collection of satellites skewered with pins and mounted in display boxes. Not necessarily MY collection.
It's going to be weird near the end of May when the screen goes blank for over 18 hours.
It's hard living somewhere with antlions, because every time you find one of their traps, you feel compelled to spend all day constructing a tiny model of Jabba's sail barge next to it.

It's hard to fit in the backseat of my flying car with my android Realdoll when we're both wearing jetpacks.

It's important to keep the spider from touching your face.
It's important to make sure your analysis destroys as much information as it produces.
It's important to note that while the effective size of the dog can be arbitrarily large, it's not any more of a good dog than the two original dogs.
It's just that I get nervous about heights.
It's kinda Zen when you think about it, if you don't think too hard.
It's like I've always said--people just need more common sense. But not the kind of common sense that lets them figure out that they're being condescended to by someone who thinks they're stupid, because then I'll be in trouble.
It's like a half-solved cryptogram where the solution is a piece of FORTH code written by someone who doesn't know FORTH.
It's like one teraspoon / when all you need is a kilonife
It's like sigma summation notation, except instead of summing the argument over all values of i, you 2 the argument over all values of 2.
It's like someone briefly joined the team running the universe, introduced their idea for a cool mechanic, then left, and now everyone is stuck pretending that this wildly unbalanced dynamic makes sense.
It's like the squirt bottle we use with the cat.
It's like the traveling salesman problem, but the endpoints are different and you can't ask your friends for help because they're sitting three seats down.
It's like they got together and said 'what do we miss most from the internet in 1998?  that's right, embedded MIDI!'
It's like they say, you gotta fight fire with clich&eacute;s.
It's like you tried to define a formal grammar based on fragments of a raw database dump from the QuickBooks file of a company that's about to collapse in an accounting scandal.
It's made me way more excited about ferris wheels, subways, car washes, waterslides, and store entrances that have double doors with a divider in the middle.
It's much better than the other one.
It's my most ambitious project yet, judging by the amount of guacamole.
It's nice how the end of the periodic table is flush with the edge these days, so I think we should agree no one should find any new elements after #118 unless they discover a whole row at once.
It's not going to break the fan, bouncing a rubber ball off the wall isn't going to dent it, and the roof can hold me just fine.  You LIED!
It's not hard when you have the same thought like 40 or 50 percent of the time.
It's not just time zones and leap seconds. SI seconds on Earth are slower because of relativity, so there are time standards for space stuff (TCB, TGC) that use faster SI seconds than UTC/Unix time. T2 - T1 = [God doesn't know and the Devil isn't telling.]
It's not my fault I haven't had a chance to measure the curvature of this particular universe.
It's not our fault we caught a group on their way home from a geography bee. And they taught us that Uzbekistan is one of the world's two doubly-landlocked countries!
It's ok, they'll always let you opt out! Like they did with the YouTube real name profile thing.
It's okay, I'm at 10%, so I'm good for another month or two.
It's okay, they can figure out which control positions produce scalding water via a trial-and-error feedback loop with a barely-perceptible 10-second lag.
It's okay, they scan the serial numbers and make sure you can't deposit the same bill more than once.
It's okay, we can just feed the one-pixel image into an AI upscaler and recover the original image, or at least one that's just as cool.
It's pi plus C, of course.
It's possible the bread and shell can be split into a top and bottom flavor, and some models additionally suggest Strange Bread and Charm Shells.
It's possible.  Better to be on the safe side.
It's probably for the best. Since Roombas are native to North America, it's illegal for Americans to keep them in their houses under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
It's probably just me. If driving were as dangerous as it seems, hundreds of people would be dying every day!
It's rare to get both astronomers and astrologers equally mad at you, but apparently I've messed up both a bunch of star location databases AND the will of the fates.
It's really hard to control the frequency, actually.
It's sad seeing those videos of turbine blade being torn apart in high winds, but it's the only way they can disperse their seeds.
It's science!
It's so sad how almost no one alive today can remember seeing the galactic rainbow, the insanity nebula, or the skull and glowing eyes of the Destroyer of Sagittarius.
It's taken me 20 years to get over skyline tetris.
It's taken me 20 years, but I've finally finished rebuilding all my software to use 33-bit signed ints.
It's the NORMAL distribution, not the TANGENT distribution.
It's time to draw the line.
It's totally a reasonable modern analogue.  Jefferson would have been all about crypto.
It's true, I think about this all the time.
It's turtles all the way down.
It's very hard to detect, but recent studies have determined that when plasma B cells are producing antibodies, they go 'pew pew pew'
J.J. Thompson won a Nobel Prize for his work in electricity in gases, but was unfairly passed over for his "An atom is plum pudding, and plum pudding is MADE of atoms! Duuuuude." theory.
James Cameron has said that he didn't know its song would be so beautiful. He didn't close the door in time. He's sorry.
James Cameron's Terminator 3 was the REALLY prophetic one. That's why Skynet sent a robot back to the 1990s to prevent him from ever making it, ultimately handing the franchise over to other directors.
James suggested this, and I have to agree.  It'd be much worse.
Jill and Jack / began to frack. / The oil boosts their town. / But fractures make / the bedrock shake / and Jack came tumbling down.
Joke's on you--the Roomba and I had a LOVELY evening.
June 21st, 365, the date of the big Mediterranean earthquake and tsunami, lived in infamy for a few centuries before fading. Maybe the trick is a catchy rhyme; the '5th of November' thing is still going strong over 400 years later.
Junior astronomers hate getting put on board update duty, but someone's gotta make sure that stuff is still up there.
Juraaaassic Park, Juraaaassic Park, God shed his grace on theeeee

Just make sure you don't have it maximize instead of minimize.
Just pretend you're kidding.
Just tell me everything you're thinking about in order from most important to last, and then we'll be friends and we can eat apples together.
Just thought you should know
Just yesterday I bought my first non-DRM'd songs (The Last Vegas, in keeping with my 'I only listen to things from Guitar Hero' theme).
Kenneth Arrow hated me because the ordering of my preferences changes based on which voting systems have what level of support. But it tells me a lot about the people I'm going to be voting with!
Key West, Virginia is not to be confused with Key, West Virginia.
Kids are genetic experiments.  We're just experimenting responsibly!
Kind of rude of them to simultaneously issue an EVACUATION - IMMEDIATE alert, a SHELTER IN PLACE alert, and a 911 TELEPHONE OUTAGE alert.
Knuth Paper-Stack Notation: Write down the number on pages. Stack them. If the stack is too tall to fit in the room, write down the number of pages it would take to write down the number. THAT number won't fit in the room? Repeat. When a stack fits, write the number of iterations on a card. Pin it to the stack.
LIFEHACKS: You can just take all the luggage off the airport conveyer belt and leave with it. They don't check that it's yours at the door!

Lambda calculus? More like SHAMbda calculus, amirite?
Last week, we busted the myth that electroweak gauge symmetry is broken by the Higgs mechanism.  We'll also examine the existence of God and whether true love exists.
Last-minute course change: Let's see if we can hit Steve's house.
Later I'm going to get a head start on the heat bath.

Later, at home: 'Dear diary: Still can't figure out what to write here ...'
Later, walking out of jail after posting $10,000 bail: "Wait, this isn't the street the county jail is on."
Later, when I remember that I'm calling movers, I frantically scribble over the labels and write 'NORMAL HOUSE STUFF' on all of them, which actually makes things worse.
Later: 'Why is there a book hovering over the trash can?'
Learning arcane bullshit from the 80s can break your computer, but if you're willing to wade through arcane bullshit from programmers in the 90s and 2000s, you can break everyone else's computers, too.
Legally-mandated information would be printed on the back or discreetly along the bottom. In small letters under the nutrition information it would say 'Like our products? Visit our website!' There would be no URL.
Let me just scroll down and check behind that rock. Annnnd ... nope, page copyright year starts with '19'. Oh God, is this a WEBRING?
Let me look away and type 'guy who's just jealous that I beat all his MarioKart times' and turn back, and ... yup, there you are again!
Let's get dinner after we promptly destroy all the X-7 we've manufactured.

Life is too short for man pages, but occasionally much too short without them.
Lifehacking!

Like spelling 'dammit' correctly -- with two m's -- it's a troll that works best on the most literate.
Linguists, settling some inscrutable grudge, have been steadily sneaking more backdated synonyms for 'sharing borders' into the dictionary. They've added 'contiguous,' 'coterminous,' 'conterminous,' and next year they're adding 'conterguous.'
Listen!  They said a team of chess players coached by someone with no understanding of basketball would never be competitive in the NBA!  Well, it turns out they're pretty perceptive.
Listen, I'm not a fan of the Spanish Inquisition OR predatory multi-level marketing schemes...
Listen, in a few thousand years you'll invent a game called 'SimCity' which has a 'disaster' button, and then you'll understand.
Listen, they request that you stop submitting a listing for your house labeled 'WHERE YOU BROKE MY HEART'.
Listen, you need to get over your reluctance to permanently alter a game. Now roll 2d6 to determine how many ounces of soda to spill into the box.
Listen, you're very cute, but if you rearrange the alphabet to put U and I together it will RUIN the spacing!
Little-known fact: The 'Dawn of Man' opening sequence in 2001 cuts away seconds before the Flintstones theme becomes recognizable.
Living in the southern hemisphere was nice because I could jump extra high, but I like it here too. Besides, if I ever want to move back, I can just curl up in a ball and wait!
Look, I just think we need to stop coddling those hedonistic roundabout hogs who get into the inner lane and circle for hours, wasting valuable capacity.
Look, recipe, if I knew how much was gonna taste good, I wouldn't need you.
Lot of drama in those days, including constant efforts to force the "Reflections on Trusting Trust" guy into retirement so we could stop being so paranoid about compilers.
Lots of people called their ships unsinkable before the Titanic. Voicing your hubris doesn't make failure more likely, just more memorable.
Love and circuit analysis, hand in hand at last.
Luckily for my interpretation, no precincts were won by the Green Party.
Luckily, the damages were partly offset by the prize money we got from accidentally winning the nearby water skiing championship tournament.
Luckily, unlike in our previous study, we have no reason to believe Evangeline the Adulterator gained access to our stored doses.
Lucky. In MY dream, all the people who grew up loving The Giving Tree paired up with all the students who had weird dreams after reading The Metamorphosis. That one was more confusing.
MY RESULTS ARE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT ON THE STATE OF THE AAAAAAAAAAAART
Ma'am, I admit that wasn't in the best taste, but you have to admire my delivery!  Ha ha, get it?  Oh God, don't throw those syringes!  Your baby's fine!
Magnetohydrodynamics combines the intuitive nature of Maxwell's equations with the easy solvability of the Navier-Stokes equations. It's so straightforward physicists add "relativistic" or "quantum" just to keep it from getting boring.
Making out with yourself: now an official xkcd theme?  Troubling.

Mars does get a good score on 'noise levels' and 'scenic views,' but the school district ranking isn't great; the only teacher--the Perseverance rover--is too busy with rock samples to teach more than the occasional weekend class.

Mathematicians give a third answer on the vertical axis, "That question is poorly defined, but we have a sub-field devoted to every plausible version of it."
Mathematicians quickly determined that it spells ANT BNECN, an unusual theoretical dish which was not successfully cooked until Andrew Wiles made it for breakfast in the 1990s.
Maybe I haven't been to Iceland because I'm busy dealing with YOUR crummy code.
Maybe I should let up on Megatokyo a little?

Maybe someday science will get over its giant collective crush on Richard Feynman.  But I doubt it!
Maybe there's no tenderness in her fingertips either, but at least SHE puts out.
Maybe we should give up on the whole idea of a 'back' button. 'Show me that thing I was looking at a moment ago' might just be too complicated an idea for the modern web.

Maybe you should keep FEWER backups; it sounds like throwing away everything you've done and starting from scratch might not be the worst idea.

Movies that I know word-for-word, part one
Mr. Jones, watch out for Ms. Lenhart! She's from genus Photuris!
Mr. Rogers projected an air of genuine, unwavering, almost saintly pure-hearted decency. But when you look deeper, at the person behind the image ... that's exactly what you find there, too. He's exactly what he appears to be.
Mrs. Roberts would have gotten up sooner, of course, but she was busy piping find ~ and find ~nomad into xargs shred, just in case.
My Deep Impact/Little Prince crossover fanfic has been poorly received by the community.

My all-time favorite example of syntactic ambiguity comes from Wikipedia: 'Charlotte's Web is a children's novel by American author E. B. White, about a pig named Wilbur who is saved from being slaughtered by an intelligent spider named Charlotte.'
My biggest fear is that colonial engineers will try to flood me to generate electricity. My biggest hope is that I'll develop sailing stones.
My biology grad student friends tell me that different types of alcohol don't actually have different effects. I trust their expertise, not because of the 'biology' part, but because of the 'grad student'.
My bracket has 76 trombones led by John Philip Sousa facing off against thousands of emperor penguins led by Morgan Freeman.
My bracket was busted in the first round; I had Massachusetts v. Connecticut in the final, probably in a case over who gets to annex Rhode Island.
My brother had a ferret he loved which died since I drew this strip.  RIP.
My brother once asked me if there was a function to produce a calendar grid from a list of dates in Google Sheets. I replied with a single-cell formula that took in a list of dates and outputted a calendar. It used SEQUENCE(), REGEXMATCH(), and a double-nested ARRAYFORMULA(), and it locked up the browser for 15 seconds every time it ran. I think he learned a lot about asking me things.
My connection to it goes way back, to my early days, when I was just a cloud of primordial hydrogen collapsing in the darkness of space.
My country's World Cup win was exciting and all, but c'mon, what if the players wore nylon wings and COULD LITERALLY FLY?

My theory is that dark matter is actually just a thin patina of grime covering the whole universe, and we don't notice it because we haven't thoroughly cleaned the place in eons.

My theory predicts that, at high enough energies, FRBs and perytons become indistinguishable because the detector burns out.
My thighs have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord?

NASA may not want to admit it, but at this point they ARE the 90's Kid Space Program.
NASA prefers to say that their rovers are 'looking for signs of past life on Mars' and not 'ghost hunting.'
NASA tries to coordinate launch timing with the Care Bears' cloud castle, but unfortunately sometimes collisions with stray Care Bears are unavoidable, so they just try to make the fairings sturdy and hope for a glancing impact.
NASCAR removed the passenger seats because drivers hated how astronauts kept riding along with them and loudly announcing "Ahh, what a nice and relaxing drive."

New research shows over 60% of the financial collapse's toxic assets were created by power drills.
New zero-day vulnerability: In addition to rowhammer, it turns out lots of servers are vulnerable to regular hammers, too.

No, YOU stumble past a series of post-breakup hookups in a daze as you slowly realize what you've lost and how unlikely you are ever to get it back first.

No, only LAVA is called 'magma' while underground. Any other object underground is called 'lava'.
No, tell the park rangers to calm down, it's fine--I put a screen on the front. I just want to get the birds a little closer.
No, the best things about The Sarah Connor Chronicles were: (1) watching Sarah and Cameron try to pass for normal, and (2) Cameron throwing people and things through walls.  Everything else was pretty secondary.
No, wait, come back! I want to be friends at you!
No, we actually do have a woman who's basically part of our fellowship. She lives in Rivendell, you wouldn't know her.

Not pictured: the elongated Halley's-Comet-like orbit of every Rebecca Black lyric.

November marks the birthday of Charles Schulz, pioneer of tongue awareness.

Obama has been writing Lincoln/Obama erotic fan fiction on his secret livejournal.  Excerpt:  Lincoln lay back on the bed, nude save for his trademark stovepipe hat.  'Tell me,' he purred seductively, as he and Obama formed a more perfect union. 'When you come, is it 10% ethanol?'
Obligatory bad guy: This operation is sheer foolishness, and it's not happening on my watch!  Mainly because I can't figure out how to adjust the time.
Obviously battery technology and prices have driven a lot of the scooter explosion, but I feel like Dean Kamen must be at least a little grumpy about how much people laughed at the idea of the Segway.
Of all the nations, the armies of the ununoctium-benders are probably the least intimidating. The xenon-benders come close, but their flickery signs are at least effective for propaganda.

Of course, I sort all my bookshelves the normal way, alphabetically (by first sentence).
Of course, Penny Arcade has already mocked themselves for this.  They don't care.
Of course, everyone has their own profile. There are morning arguers, hangry arguers, meal-time arguers, late-night arguers, and people who get in a meta-argument over what their argument timing is, dredge up examples of past arguments, and end up fighting over THOSE again as well.
Of course, factions immediately sprang up in favor of '~*~sTaR tReK iNtO dArKnEsS~*~', 'xX_StAr TrEk InTo DaRkNess_Xx', and 'Star Trek lnto Darkness' (that's a lowercase 'L').

Of course, the assert doesn't work.
Of course, you don't wanna limit yourself to the strict forms of the meter.  That could get pretty difficult.

Ok, but make sure to get lots of pieces of rock, because later we'll decide to stay in a room on our regular orb and watch hammers hold themselves and hit rocks for us, and they won't bring us very many rocks.
Ok, how many coins for a cinnamon roll?
Ok, plan B: Fly a kite into the blades, with a rock in a sling dangling below it, and create the world's largest trebuchet.
Ok, so Spirit and Opportunity are pretty awesome. And Kepler. And New Horizons, Cassini, Curiosity, TiME, and Project M. But c'mon, if the Earth were a basketball, in 40 years no human's been more than half an inch from the surface.

Old people used to write obnoxious thinkpieces about how people these days always wear watches and are slaves to the clock, but now they've switched to writing thinkpieces about how kids these days don't appreciate the benefits of an old-fashioned watch. My position is: The word 'thinkpiece' sounds like a word made up by someone who didn't know about the word 'brain'.
On January 26th, 2274 Mars days into the mission, NASA declared Spirit a 'stationary research station', expected to stay operational for several more months until the dust buildup on its solar panels forces a final shutdown.
On Mondays I go running, so you'll have to get up early and follow along on a parallel street.  What fun!
On one hand, every single one of my ancestors going back billions of years has managed to figure it out.  On the other hand, that's the mother of all sampling biases.
On one hand, you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch. On the other hand, you'll never be able to convince your parents to switch!
On the news a few days later: "Buzz is building around the so-called 'camping Roomba' after a big investment. Preorders have spiked, and..."
On the other hand, as far as they know, my system is working perfectly.
On the other hand, it took us embarrassingly long to clue in to the lung cancer/cigarette thing, so I guess the real lesson is "figuring out which ideas are true is hard."
On the other hand, physicists like to say physics is to math as sex is to masturbation.
On the other hand, poor Samara -- transcoded to FLV.  No one deserves that.
On the other hand, the refractor's limited light-gathering means it's unable to make out shadow people or the dark god Chernabog.
On the plus side, she wrote 'Welcome to the AAA Club!' in lipstick on the bathroom mirror, and left me a membership/roadside assistance card on the counter.

One of the survivors, poking around in the ruins with the point of a spear, uncovers a singed photo of Richard Stallman. They stare in silence. "This," one of them finally says, "This is a man who BELIEVED in something."
One of the things of bear spray says that, and I'm not one to disobey safety instructions, but there are no bears around here. Guess it's time for a camping trip where we leave lots of food out!

Other pollsters complain about declining response rates, but our poll showed that 96% of respondents would be 'somewhat likely' or 'very likely' to agree to answer a series of questions for a survey.

Our phones must have great angular momentum sensors because the compasses really suck.
Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. There is no road out of this oblivion; we must embrace it. We must join with the darkness. Ba'al the Annihilator offers us no happiness, no answers, naught but the cold embrace of the void. To imagine any other end is delusion. We must give in to the will of Ba'al, for he will one day consume us and our world alike. I therefore call on Congress to fully fund space exploration, and to join with Ba'al, the Eater of Souls. Thank you.

People get really grumpy when they realize you're giving them directions for how to go to the store and buy a GPS.

People keep telling me to use the radio but I really hate making voice calls.
People keep trying to come up with reasons that we should worry about the magnetic field collapsing or reversing, but honestly I think it's fine. Whatever minor problems it causes will be made up for by the mid-latitude auroras.
People may complain about readability, but even with jpeg compression, extracting the data points is usually computationally feasible if there aren't too many of them.
People often say that same-sex marriage now is like interracial marriage in the 60s. But in terms of public opinion, same-sex marriage now is like interracial marriage in the 90s, when it had already been legal nationwide for 30 years.
People tell me I have too much time on my hands, but really the problem is that there's too much time, PERIOD.
People with all six of those names agree that it's weird that we have teeth, when you think about it for too long. Just about everyone agrees on that, except—in a still-unexplained statistical anomaly—people named "Trevor."
Perhaps you need a crash course in taking hints. Here's your first lesson: We're not actually walking somewhere together; I'm trying to leave this conversation and you're following me.
Phil Plait once pointed out that you can calculate the total angular area of the sky this way. If the sky is a sphere with radius 57.3 degrees, then its area is 4*pi*r^2=41,253 square degrees. This makes dimensional analysts SO mad, but you can't argue with results.

Psychology researchers say our 'flashbulb' memories of big events can be unreliable, but I clearly remember watching live on CNN as Challenger crashed into and destroyed the Berlin Wall.
Pythagorean means are nice and all, but throwing the median in the pot is really what turns this into random forest statistics: applying every function you can think of, and then gradually dropping the ones that make the result worse.

Some future reader, who may see the term, without knowing the history of it, may imagine that it had reference to some antiquated bridge of the immortal Poet, thrown across the silver Avon, to facilitate his escape after some marauding excursion in a neighbouring park; and in some Gentleman's Magazine of the next century, it is not impossible, but that future antiquaries may occupy page after page in discussing so interesting a matter. We think it right, therefore, to put it on record in the Oriental Herald that the 'Shakesperian Rope Bridges' are of much less classic origin; that Mr Colin Shakespear, who, besides his dignity as Postmaster, now signs himself 'Superintendent General of Shakesperian Rope Bridges', is a person of much less genius than the Bard of Avon. --The Oriental Herald, 1825
Some of the KBCU ancillary works try a little too hard to tie everything together. Doris Kearns Goodwin, the sports journalist featured in "Baseball," was somehow ALSO a famous historian who wrote bestselling biographies of Lincoln AND Johnson? Unrealistic.

That track ('Battle Without Honor or Humanity') -- like 'Ride of the Valkyries' -- improves *any* activity.
That's a gneiss butte.
That's actually the original Japanese version of A Million Random Digits, which is much better than the American remake the book was based on.
That's my hat!  You took my hat!
That's nothing.  I once lost my genetics, rocketry, and stripping licenses in a single incident.
That's very exciting! The bad news is that it's a risk factor for a lot of things.
The #2 cause of astronomer hand injuries is trying to do vector math when the second axis points off to the right.
The 'controlled demolition' theory was concocted by the government to distract us. '9/11 was an inside job' was an inside job!
The 1919 Great Boston Molasses Flood remained the deadliest confectionery containment accident until the Canadian Space Agency's 2031 orbital maple syrup delivery disaster.
The 2007 Bridge to Terebithia trailer put me off too much to see that particular movie, but I am cautiously optimistic about Where the Wild Things Are.
The 538TR attempts to capture a player's combined skill at basketball (either real-life or NBA 2K18) and election forecasting.

The 95% confidence interval suggests Rexthor's dog could also be a cat, or possibly a teapot.
The <x> that is held by <y> is also a <y><x>, so if you go to a food truck, the stuff you buy is truck food. A phone that's in your car is a carphone, and a car equipped with a phone is a phonecar. When you play a mobile racing game, you're in your phonecar using your carphone to drive a different phonecar. I'm still not sure about bananaphones.
The AARP puts the average age of a first-time grandparent close to 50, and the CDC has some data. But I don't have first-parent age distributions for specific names, or generational first-child age correlations, so the dotted line is just a guess. Still, let's be honest: No further research is really *needed.*
The AYB retro-return-date (Zero Wing Zero Hour) should be around AD 2021.
The Antikythera mechanism had a whole set of gears specifically to track the cyclic popularity of skinny jeans and low-rise waists.
The Atlantic is expanding at about 10 ppm (points per month).
The BBC lead was 'The elusive erogenous zone said to exist in some women may be a myth, say researchers who have hunted for it.'  I couldn't read it with a straight face.
The Banach-Tarski theorem was actually first developed by King Solomon, but his gruesome attempts to apply it set back set theory for centuries.
The Carnot cycle is more properly known by its full title, the "Carnot-Tolkien-Wagner Ring Cycle."
The E's wedding invitation definitely used the word LOVE more times than was strictly necessary.
The Earth is, on average, located in the habitable zone, but at any given time it has a certain probability of being outside it, which is why life exists on Earth but is mortal.
The Earth's five major mass extinctions were the Posh Extinction, the Sporty Extinction, the Scary Extinction, the Ginger Extinction, and the Baby Extinction.
The Earth's magnetic field is primarily generated by currents in the liquid outer core, though some geophysicists argue that an unexplained mismatch with models suggests that the Kinder toy contains a magnet.
The Fujita Scale was replaced by the Enhanced Fujita Scale in 2007, but I think 'EF-5' sounds stupid, so I vote we just use the new measurements for assigning numbers but still call them 'F-whatever'.
The G1, especially with the new Android upgrade, is way better than I originally thought.
The Gordian knot is an omniknot tied using every bend in the Ashley Book of Knots, and then for extra security the upper rope at every crossing is connected to the lower with a randomly-chosen hitch.
The Greeks long suspected this, but it wasn't until April 12th of 1882 that Ferdinand von Lindemann conclusively proved it when he constructed himself the most awesome birthday party possible and nobody showed up.

The IAU ban came after the 'redefinition of 'planet' to include the IAU president's mom' incident.
The IAU is sad to announce that at 00:39 UTC on December 22nd, Jupiter and Saturn did unfortunately come into contact, and appear to have blooped together.
The ISO 216 standard ratio is cos(45°), but American letter paper is 8.5x11 because it uses radians, and 8.5/11 = pi/4.
The LEGO Group is already the world's largest tire manufacturer.
The LINACs in the glasses frames can barely manage one MeV. You should've gone to the screening at CERN.
The Late Heavy Bombardment was followed a few billion years later by the Comparatively Light but Oddly Specific Bombardment.
The Lord of the Rings sequel, set years after the Ring hubbub has died down, is just Samwise discreetly creeping back to Bag End to finish dropping the eaves.
The MythBusters are even more sinister.
The MythBusters need to tackle whether a black hole from the LHC could REALLY destroy the world.
The New Worlds Mission is already trying to get funding for this, but NASA sponsored their proposal, so it will be hard to catch the telescope people by surprise with it.

The Street View van isn't going to find out anything Google won't already know from reading my email.
The Strong Collatz Conjecture states that this holds for any set of obsessively-hand-applied rules.
The Stroop-YORP number of a scientific paper is how many of the 16 finalist names (sans 'effect') it manages to casually sneak into the text.
The Super Bowl is actually an elaborate ruse, concocted by a shadowy group in the mid sixties for this purpose.  The 'watch it for the ads' addition was a master stroke.

The Taylor series should have been canceled after the first term.
The TempurPedic wineglass guy broke his ankle.

The article has twenty-three citations, one of which is an obscure manuscript from the 1490's and the other twenty-two are arguments on LanguageLog.
The articles are much shorter, but I assume that's because this version predates the merger with the Hawaiian text that created the modern Hawaiian-Greek hybrid wiki-pedia.
The astro-ph.SR arXiv servers are simultaneously being overwhelmed by electronic requests and actual electricity.
The average error in the NHC forecasted position of a hurricane three days in the future has shrunk to a third of what it was in 1990--a staggering accomplishment. However, as you may have gathered, forecasts of future storm *strength* have proved more difficult to improve.
The ball's density also varies, but players don't learn the value until after choosing their raquets. The infamous 'bowling ball table tennis' region of the parameter space often leads to equipment damage.
The best camera is the one at L2.
The best hugs are probably from hagfish, which can extrude microscopic filaments that convert a huge volume of water around them to slime in seconds. Instant cozy blanket!
The best part of crashing a Mars briefing is you can get in a full 11 minutes of questions before they can start to respond.
The best place to be for a hug eclipse is a scenic natural area with good views and few clouds. The worst place to be is the lunar surface.

The biggest jump is at 11:00am EST (4:00pm UTC) when midnight reaches the UTC+8 time zone. That time zone, which includes China, is home to a quarter of the world's population. India and Sri Lanka (UTC+5:30) put us over the 50% mark soon after.
The blueprints for the Department of the Internet offices call for Ceiling Cat-themed sprinkler heads.
The bottom of the list remains unchanged. Poor Rutherford Birchard Hayes.
The bruises on my fingertips are my proof of work.

The contagious period ends right around when you start to sound sick over the phone, which is probably evidence of cold viruses evolving to spread optimally in the workplace.
The contents of any one panel are dependent on the contents of every panel including itself. The graph of panel dependencies is complete and bidirectional, and each node has a loop. The mouseover text has two hundred and forty-two characters.
The cycle seems to be 'we need these symbols to clarify what types of things we're referring to!' followed by 'wait, it turns out words already do that.'
The days of the week are Monday, Arctic, Wellesley, Green, Electra, Synergize, and the Seventh Seal.
The debate over the correct Messier number for the Ship of Theseus is ongoing.
The definitions I grew up with were that a geek is someone unusually into something (so you could have computer geeks, baseball geeks, theater geeks, etc) and nerds are (often awkward) science, math, or computer geeks. But definitions vary.
The distinction between a ship and a boat is a line drawn in water.
The dose is much lower when administered orally. We're still trying to get the paper into the needles for subcutaneous injection.
The dump also contains a list of millions of prime factors, a 0-day Tamagotchi exploit, and a technique for getting gcc and bash to execute arbitrary code.
The end.
The establishment doesn't take us seriously. You know who else they didn't take seriously? Hitler. I'll be like him, but a GOOD guy instead of...

The fact that things like the npm left-pad incident are so rare is oddly reassuring.
The failures usually don't hurt anything, and if it installs several versions, it increases the chance that one of them is right. (Note: The 'yes' command and '2>/dev/null' are recommended additions.)
The few dozen doors that have little Christmas trees on them are a nice touch.
The fifth panel also applies to postmodernists.
The film is set in 2018, but when Commander Bremberly chases the hologram through Times Square, there's a billboard for Avengers: Age of Ultron. Depending on the date, that billboard would have been advertising either Infinity War or this movie.
The flags were probably vaporized on impact, because we launched it before we had finished figuring out how to land. That makes sense from an engineering standpoint, but also feels like a metaphor.
The flood of PermaCalNTP leap-second notifications was bad enough, but when people started asking for millisecond resolution, the resulting DDOS brought down the internet.
The floor should be slightly curved, but we haven't figured out artificial gravity yet, so for now we just added a trace intoxicating gas to the air that messes with your inner ear and gives you a sense that the ground is tilting away from you.
The foil on the toothpick represents the blue flash.
The full analysis is of course much more complicated, but I can't stay to talk about it because I have a date.
The git vehicle fleet eventually pivoted to selling ice cream, but some holdovers remain. If you flag down an ice cream truck and hand the driver a floppy disk, a few hours later you'll get an invite to a git repo.
The good news is that according to the latest IPCC report, if we enact aggressive emissions limits now, we could hold the warming to 2°C. That's only HALF an ice age unit, which is probably no big deal.
The good news is that if the number of work and friend relationships you have exceeds your willingness to do the bare minimum to keep up with everyone's life events and stuff, one way or another that problem eventually solves itself.
The government has been trying to sell off the Federal Helium Reserve for a few years now, but the sale has been on hold while they try to figure out how to explain this situation to buyers.
The graph is of the magnitude of the function with the real value between 0 and 2 and the imaginary between about 35 and 40.  I've misplaced the exact parameters I used.
The great thing is, the sentence is really just a reminder to the listener to worry about whatever aspects of the technology they're already feeling alarmist about, which in their mind gives you credit for addressing their biggest anxieties.
The hard part about opening a hole in the proof of the Poincaré conjecture is that Grigori Perelman will come out of retirement to try to fix it by drawing a loop around the hole and contracting it to a point.
The hardest refresh requires both a Mac keyboard and a Windows keyboard as a security measure, like how missile launch systems require two keys to be turned at once.
The heartfelt tune it plays is CC licensed, and you can get it from my seed on JoinDiaspora.com whenever that project gets going.
The heat index is calculated via looking up the "effective temperature" in a table of air temperature and humidity values, and then adding a bunch more degrees because it feels WAY hotter than that.
The henchmen Bebop and Rocksteady have hijacked the musical genres for us just like the Lone Ranger hijacked the William Tell Overture for our parents.

The invisible hand of the market never texts me back.
The joke will be on him in a few weeks when animal control shows up and takes custody of his Roomba.

The key is portion control, which is why I've switched to eating smaller cans of frosting instead of full bottles.
The key to discovering life on Mars is to find someone who built a camera and landed it on Mars. Then you just look through the pictures for plants and dogs and stuff.
The last band of color indicates the snake's tolerance for being held before biting.
The laws of physics are fun to try to understand, but as an organism with incredibly delicate eyes who evolved in a world full of sharp objects, I have an awful lot of trust in biology's calibration of my flinch reflex.

The less popular 8.8.4.4 is slated for discontinuation.
The likely shape of the bells was determined through consultation with several bellringing experts at the Tower of London. Transcripts of those interviews are available in Appendix VII.

The local police, growing increasingly concerned about this church, ask parishioners to take a sip of wine and then spit it back out for DNA testing. It's blood, and it matches a 1970s murder victim.
The mainstream dogma sparked a wave of dogmatic revisionism, and this revisionist mainstream dogmatism has now given way to a more rematic mainvisionist dogstream.
The malaria party was David's idea

The misguided search for a perpetual motion machine has run substantially longer than any attempted perpetual motion machine.
The moment their arms spun freely in our air, they were doomed -- for Man has earned his right to hold this planet against all comers, by virtue of occasionally producing someone totally batshit insane.

The most brutal way I've ever seen someone handle this was 'Oh, you have a girlfriend. Are you going to get married?'  'I, uh, don't know--' 'Well, do you love her?' '...' 'Anyway, what were you saying about the movie?'
The most delicious exotic fruit discovered this way is the strawberry banana. Sadly, it's only stable in puree form, so it's currently limited to yogurt and smoothies, but they're building a massive collider in Europe to search for a strawberry banana that can be eaten whole.
The most important attributes of a vector in 3-space are {Location, Location, Location}
The most ridiculous offender of all is the sudoers man page, which for 15 years has started with a 'quick guide' to EBNF, a system for defining the grammar of a language. 'Don't despair', it says, 'the definitions below are annotated.'
The new crowd is heavily shaped by this guy named Eric, who's basically the Paris Hilton of the amateur plastic crazy straw design world.
The next day: 'What? Six bank robberies!? But I just vandalized the library!' 'Nice try. They saw your plate with all the 1's and I's.' 'That's impossible! I've been with my car the whole ti-- ... wait. Ok, wow, that was clever of her.'
The nice thing about headcannnons is that it's really easy to get other people to believe in them.

The one time I tried, I got hit by a slinky going down at double speed.
The only big difference I've seen is in colors.  Where the regular text reads 'press red button', the braille reads 'press two-inch button'.
The only blood these contracts are signed in is from me cutting my hand trying to open the goddamn CD case.
The only downside is that it would be a little uncomfortable
The only effect on the history books were a few confusing accounts of something called 'Greek fire.'
The only one of these games I really played was Area 51
The only other Wikipedia vandalism that I would feel zero remorse about is editing the article on active US militia groups to replace "militia" with "fanclub".
The only other person to walk by was a linguist back in the 80s, but she just spent a while dissecting the phrase 'help me down' before getting distracted by a squirrel and wandering off.
The only post to achieve perfect balance between the four was a hilarious joke about Mark Zuckerberg getting caught using a pseudonym to sneak past the TSA.
The only things you HAVE to know are how to make enough of a living to stay alive and how to get your taxes done. All the fun parts of life are optional.
The only winning move is to play, perfectly, waiting for your opponent to make a mistake.
The other great lakes are just water on the far side of Canada Island. If you drive north from the Pacific northwest you actually cross directly into Alaska, although a few officials--confused by the Mercator distortion--have put up border signs.
The other half has some cool shipwrecks, rocks, and snakes, but if you move those out of the way, it also has more sky.
The other side of USB-C is rotationally symmetric except that the 3rd pin from the top is designated FIREWIRE TRIBUTE PIN.
The other two are still lost on the infinite plane of uniform density.
The penis varies in size when flaccid and is pretty consistently about yea big when erect.  Anyway, back to the sitcom one-liners and the constant flow of spam.
The phantom found Edward Everett Hale a century too early; by the time we invented satellites, the specifics of his 'brick moon' proposal were dismissed as science fiction.
The phone will be collected by the toll operators and mailed back to you within 4-6 weeks.
The pile gets soaked with data and starts to get mushy over time, so it's technically recurrent.

The problem with perspective is that it's bidirectional.
The problems started with my resolution next year to reject temporal causality.
The projection does a good job preserving both distance and azimuth, at the cost of really exaggerating how many South Americas there are.
The projection for those who think the Mercator projection gives people a distorted idea of how big Greenland is, but a very accurate idea of how big it SHOULD be.
The projection's north pole is in a small lake on the island of Mahé in the Seychelles, which is off the top of the map and larger than the rest of the Earth's land area combined.
The prosecution calls Gottfried Leibniz.
The question with Lucy and the football was always whether, on some level, she believed the things she said.
The rarest of all clouds is the altocumulenticulostratonimbulocirruslenticulomammanoctilucent cloud, caused by an interaction between warm moist air, cool dry air, cold slippery air, cursed air, and a cloud of nanobots.
The rat's perturbed; it must sense nanobots! Code grey!  We have a Helvetica scenario!

The robot is pregnant.  It isn't mine.
The rope keeps breaking, I'm covered in bruises and scrapes, and I've barely reached the end of my driveway, but I don't care--I'm determined to become the first person to commute to work by tetherball.
The safe is empty except for an unsolved 5x5 Rubik's cube.
The same goes for the one where you're wrestling the Green Ranger in the swimming pool full of Crisco.  You guys all have that dream, right?  It's not just me.  Right?
The same people who spend their weekends at the Blogger Reenactment Festivals will whine about the anachronisms in historical movies, but no one else will care.
The social media reaction to this asteroid announcement has been sharply negative. Care to respond?

The theory finally unifies cosmic inflation and regular inflation.
The third row will probably have to wait until 2034, and maybe longer. If I see a daytime supernova, I'll replace the meteor storm with that and consider it 3/3.
The thrower started hitting the bats too much, so the king of the game told him to leave and brought out another thrower from thrower jail.

The typical Shadow Biology Department is housed in a building coated in a thin layer of desert varnish which renders it invisible to normal-world university staff.
The typical internet user (who wants to share) has an IQ of 147 and a 9-inch penis. Well, better than the reverse, I guess.
The universe fandom is great. Such sweet and enthusiastic people.
The universe is probably littered with the one-planet graves of cultures which made the sensible economic decision that there's no good reason to go into space--each discovered, studied, and remembered by the ones who made the irrational decision.
The universe long dead, IsaAC surveyed the formless chaos. At last, he had arrived at an answer. 'I like you,' he declared to the void, 'but I don't LIKE like you.'
The universe started in 1970.  Anyone claiming to be over 38 is lying about their age.
The use of the 'Garfield' character for the purposes of this parody qualifies as fair use under the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. sec. 107.  See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music (92-1292), 510 U.S. 569
The vaccine stuff seems pretty simple. But if you take a closer look at the data, it's still simple, but bigger. And slightly blurry. Might need reading glasses.

The warning diamond on the Materials Safety Data Sheet for this stuff just has the "😰" emoji in all four fields.
The wars between the "OTHER PRIMATES OPEN THEM FROM THE SMALL END" faction versus the "BUT THE LITTLE BIT OF BANANA AT THE SMALL END IS GROSS" faction consumed Europe for generations.
The way out is to use the marker you have to add a box that says 'get a marker' to the line between you and 'start', then add a 'no' line from the trap box to 'end'.
The weak twin primes conjecture states that there are infinitely many pairs of primes. The strong twin primes conjecture states that every prime p has a twin prime (p+2), although (p+2) may not look prime at first. The tautological prime conjecture states that the tautological prime conjecture is true.
The weird sense of duty really good sysadmins have can border on the sociopathic, but it's nice to know that it stands between the forces of darkness and your cat blog's servers.
The weirdest quirk of the Borda count is that Jean-Charles de Borda automatically gets one point; luckily this has no consequences except in cases of extremely low turnout.
The wolves thin the RAID arrays, removing the slowest and weakest disks to keep the average seek speed high.
The worst are graphs with qualitative, vaguely-labeled axes and very little actual data.
The worst is being teased by responsible, mask-wearing teens. They even spritz the hamster ball with disinfectant before rolling it, carefully avoiding the filter vents.
The worst is the Terrible Twos, when they're always throwing things and shrieking, "forsooth, to bed thou shalt not take me, cur!"
The worst is when you run out of monospaced fonts and have to use variable-width variables.
The worst part is that's the millisigma interval.
The worst part is when sidewalk cracks are out-of-sync with your natural stride.

The xkcd Survey: Big Data for a Big Planet
The xkcd.com sysadmin has a Q2010, and I can attest that it can handle a fall down several flight of concrete steps.  Relatedly, he's upset with me -- I hope he doesn't take revenge by messing with my site's contenDISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS
The younger folk in the audience think this is a joke.
Their 'best philosophy of epistemology' picks are great, but you can tell they're struggling a little in the 'why you should trust us' section.
Their Sun and gravity will make you, uh, something, I guess. Out of earshot from Earth, mostly.
Their biggest mistake was bringing Rachael Ray and Emeril to tour the lab and sign off on the project.  That's when Spielberg caught wind of it.
Their crash investigation team had some particularly harsh words for Dave Matthews.
Their signature play is the three-point combinator, a recursive offense which is guaranteed not to halt and continues accumulating points until the buzzer.
Themistocles said his infant son ruled all Greece -- "Athens rules all Greece; I control Athens; my wife controls me; and my infant son controls her." Thus, nowadays the world is controlled by whoever buys advertising time on Dora the Explorer.
Then I'll start work on my lunar engines to line the Moon up with the ecliptic so we can have a solar eclipse every month (with a little wobble so they're not always on the equator.)
Then I'm going to go on a weeks-long somatic hypermutation bender, producing ever-more targeted antibodies, while I continue to remain distanced and follow guidance from public health authorities.
Then it switched to these old black-and-white tapes of Bob Ross slumped against the wall of an empty room, painting the least happy trees you've ever seen. Either PBS needs to beef up studio security or I need to stop using Ambien to sleep.
Then we move to phase two. Gas stations store fuel in underground tanks. Normally, these are inaccessible except via the pump. However, with hydraulic fracturing, we-- Wait! Come back!

Theory: Smugness is proportional to the negative second derivative of TV ownership rate with respect to time.
Theranos partnership: Sorry, we know, but we signed the contract back before all the stuff and the lawyers say we can't back out, so just try to keep your finger away from the bottom of the phone.

There are a lot of graduate-educated young-earth creationists.
There are actually lowercase-like 'oldstyle' forms of normal numbers with more pronounced ascenders and descenders, which is why some numbers like '5' in books sometimes dangle below the line. But the true capital numbers remain the domain of number maven Mavis Beacon.
There are also a lot of global versions of this map showing traffic to English-language websites which are indistinguishable from maps of the location of internet users who are native English speakers.
There are at least fourteen ways this could go badly (seventeen if that fork is a dangerous crossbreed.)
There are lots of very smart people doing fascinating work on cryptographic voting protocols. We should be funding and encouraging them, and doing all our elections with paper ballots until everyone currently working in that field has retired.
There are more Trump voters in California than Texas, more Biden voters in Texas than New York, more Trump voters in New York than Ohio, more Biden voters in Ohio than Massachusetts, more Trump voters in Massachusetts than Mississippi, and more Biden voters in Mississippi than Vermont.

There are some papers arguing that there's a volcanic component, but I personally think they're just feeling guilty and trying to cover the trail.
There are two or three songs out there with beeps in the chorus that sound exactly like the clock radio alarm I had in high school, and hearing it makes me think my life since junior year has been a dream I'm about to wake up from.

There used to be these ads, see . . .
There was a schism in 2007, when a sect advocating OpenOffice created a fork of Sunday.xlsx and maintained it independently for several months. The efforts to reconcile the conflicting schedules led to the reinvention, within the cells of the spreadsheet, of modern version control.
There was no alt-text until you moused over
There was something about a cup and a sword and a tree and a green hill ...
There were actually some good reasons for those laws, but IMO they now do more harm than good. Which raises a question: If there's a ballot measure to strike them down, how can I resist the urge to take a picture of my "yes" vote?
There were traffic jams for the eclipses in 1970 and 1979, and that was *before* we had the potential for overnight viral social media frenzies.
There's Livejournal drama between those who want to wear human suits over fursuits and those who just take off the fursuits.

There's a red convertible outside my building with the license plate 'DADS MNY'.

There's a version that shows the planets with no cropping, but it's hard to find a display that supports it.
There's also a +1 sometimes, which is there to keep everyone on their toes. In the future, people who got to pick cool numbers by signing up for Google Voice early will be revered as wizards.
There's also a Katamari level where everything is just slightly bigger than you, and a Mario level with a star just out of reach.
There's also a unicode-handling bug in the URL request library, and we're storing the passwords unsalted ... so if we salt them with emoji, we can close three issues at once!

There's also the TV show based on the hit Hot and Cold Music books: Fun With Chairs, Royal Rumble, Knife Blizzard, Breakfast for Birds, and Samba Serpents.
There's always the hope that if you sit and watch for long enough, the beachball will vanish and the thing it interrupted will return.
There's an intersection I drive through sometimes that has a forward green arrow, a red light, and a 'no turns' sign all on one pole. I honestly have no idea what it's telling me to do.

There's no "I" in "VOWELS".
There's no group chat member more enigmatic than the cool person who you all assume has the chat on mute, but who then instantly chimes in with no delay the moment something relevant to them is mentioned.
There's nothing hotter than porn dubbed over with a poorly-mic'd teenager's voice explaining each step in a droning monotone. 'okay, we're almost at the spawn point ... separate the labia, but watch out, there are more inside them ..."
There's one person in Missouri who says "carbo bev" who the entire rest of the country HATES.
There's planned downtime every night when we turn on the Roomba and it runs over the cord.
There's quark color, but that's not really color--it's just an admission by 20th century physicists that numbers are boring.
There's some flexibility depending on your standards for measuring runtime and the various special editions. If you still want to have a party, I'm sure you can find some combination that works.
There's still a chance you were conceived via IVF. But we've checked your mom's college yearbook photos, and whether or not she and your father had sex, it's clear that ... listen, I know this is hard for you.
There's this idea that emoji are bad for communication because they replace ambiguity and nuance with a limited set of preselected emotions, but it doesn't really survive a collision with real-world usage of the thinking face or upside-down smiley.
There, I showed you it.
These anomalies are known as Miyake events, named for the pioneering scientist who discovered them and was tragically devoured by a carnivorous tree.

These neutrinos were freshly produced by a local source just 8 minutes ago
These new Bluetooth socks are great, but it's troubling to learn that I average almost 14 hours of Shoe Time a day.
These pranks happen all the time. English doesn't allow one-syllable words to end in a lax vowel, so writers on The Simpsons decided to mess with future linguists by introducing the word "meh."
These signals seem to be pre-star-formation but post-Malone.
They CLAIM honey was found in the chambers under the pyramids, but this conspiracy goes all the way to the TOP, where the GIANT EYE is!
They actually showed up on the first scan by the first WiFi-capable device.
They actually started the reversed-text practice in 1977 -- not for ease-of-reading reasons, but because too many people were driving backward down the highway blasting the Star Wars opening theme.
They all made fun of Autometalogolex, but someday there will be a problem with Christmas that can only be solved if Santa somehow gets a serious headache, and then they'll see.
They also showed activation in the parts of the brain associated with exposure to dubious study methodology, concern about unremoved piercings, and exasperation with fMRI techs who won't stop talking about Warped Tour.
They always try to explain that they're called 'solar physicists', but the reporters interrupt with "NEVER MIND THAT, TELL US WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE SUN!"
They are six-legged spiders
They could afford to cut it close because they all had Global Entry.
They could say "the connection is probably lost," but it's more fun to do naive time-averaging to give you hope that if you wait around for 1,163 hours, it will finally finish.
They estimate the rocket should be free by approximately ... uh ... well, in about two hours.
They eventually resolved this self-reference, but Cantor's 'everything-in-the-fetish-book-twice' parties finally sunk the idea.
They have a telescope pointed RIGHT AT US!

They might make it past that first line of defense. For the second, you'll need some picture frames, a level, and a protractor that can do increments of less than a degree.
They offered to make me a green beret, but I liked my regular one. Although it gets kind of squashed under my helmet.
They often use ball lenses to collect light at the ends of optical fibers, so when you look stuff up on the internet you're actually scrying through a crystal ball.
They said after I got into a routine, I'd enjoy getting progressively stronger and stop whining so much about how hard exercise was. Well, they were half right!
They say if a mathematician doesn't do their great work by age eleven, they never will.
They say you can't argue with results, but what kind of defeatist attitude is that? If you stick with it, you can argue with ANYTHING.
They tried to report me to the authorities, but because I had the device they couldn't charge me.
They try to pad their numbers in the annual reports by counting Galileo's redundant systems as multiple computers, but they're falling behind badly either way.

They'd convince me to come out of retirement for one last job: biting into a giant lump of slightly soft wax a couple of times.
They'd use that Futurama episode with Fry's dog, but even spambots cry at that.
They'll pick music and culture that they know annoys you.  Building in behavioral easter eggs is a fair retaliation!
They're a little cagey about exactly where the crossover point lies relative to the likelihood of devastating effects on the planet.
They're also refusing to fund my device that demonstrates uncontrolled hot fusion.
They're limiting the playtesters to type A3 V stars, so the games will all end before the Sun consumes the Earth.
They're really the worst tech support team. And their solutions are always the same. "This OS X update broke something." "LET'S INFILTRATE APPLE BY MORPHING APPLES!"
They're robust against quantum attacks because it's hard to make a quantum system that large.
They're standing at the lip of the canyon, which isn't clear at all.
They've endowed a separate prize in Physiology or Medicine or Stopping Dr. Adams.

This exotic blade was wrought from a different fallen star. The meteorite was a carbonaceous chondrite, so it's basically a lump of gravel glued into the shape of a sword. A SPACE sword!
This happens in geek circles every so often. The 'Hey, this is just a system I can figure out easily!' is also a problem among engineers first diving into the stock market.

This is how I explain computer problems to my cat. My cat usually seems happier than me.
This is my four-digit PIN. It was passed down to me by my father, and someday I will pass it on to you. Unless we figure out how to update it, but that sounds complicated.
This is probably the first projection in cartographic history that can be criticized for its disproportionate focus on Finland, Mongolia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
This is roughly equivalent to 'number of times I've picked up a seashell at the ocean' / 'number of times I've picked up a seashell', which in my case is pretty close to 1, and gets much closer if we're considering only times I didn't put it to my ear.
This is silly, of course.  The enemy will be born in the network.
This is something we all need to work on, but especially you all.
This is true.  The lyrics are ridiculous.
This isn't an informational illustration; this is a thing I think we should do. First, we'll need a gigantic spool of thread. Next, we'll need some kind of ... hmm, time to head to Seattle.
This map preserves the shapes of Tissot's indicatrices pretty well, as long as you draw them in before running the resize.
This medicine says it may cause lightheadedness, dry mouth, and blurred vision, but my head feels incredibly heavy, water is pouring from my mouth, and I can see individual hummingbird wingbeats, so I think I'm fine.

This really is a true story, and she doesn't know I put it in my comic because her wifi hasn't worked for weeks.
This really validates Jones's strategy of getting several thousand more votes than Smith. In retrospect, that was a smart move; those votes were crucial.

This well-known effect has of course been replicated in countless experiments.
This white-balance illusion hit so hard because it felt like someone had been playing through the Monty Hall scenario and opened their chosen door, only to find there was unexpectedly disagreement over whether the thing they'd revealed was a goat or a car.
This works for a surprising range of sunlit things, including rooftops (sure), highway surfaces (probably not), sailboats (maybe), and jets, cars, and wild deer (haha good luck).
This works on pretty much every level.
This would be bad enough, but every 30th or 40th pokéball has TWO of them inside.

To avoid errors like this, we render all text and pipe it through OCR before processing, fixing a handful of irregular bugs by burying them beneath a smooth, uniform layer of bugs.
To be fair, my job at NASA was working on robots and didn't actually involve any orbital mechanics. The small positive slope over that period is because it turns out that if you hang around at NASA, you get in a lot of conversations about space.
To be fair, the braised and confused newt on a bed of crushed Doritos turned out to be delicious.
To compensate for this, I plan to spend 2013 doing nothing but talking about Mayans. My relationships with my friends and family may not fare well.

Twister would've been a much better movie if they'd cut out the bad-guy storm chaser and all the emotional romance crap.  All you need for a good movie are tornados and scientists.  Actually, that's all you need for anything.

Ultra-Serial Violet C light is unpolarized, so you don't have to flip the polarizing filter over when you get the orientation wrong the first time.
Umwelt is the idea that because their senses pick up on different things, different animals in the same ecosystem actually live in very different worlds. Everything about you shapes the world you inhabit--from your ideology to your glasses prescription to your web browser.

Update: It turns out the cannon has a motorized base, and can make holes just fine using the barrel itself as a battering ram. But due to design constraints it won't work without a projectile loaded in, so we still need those drills.

We were able to replicate and confirm prior authors' detection of a moon orbiting the Earth with high confidence.
We were going to do a falling-apart Rubik's cube that was just 27 independent blocks stuck together with magnets, but then we realized it was actually really cool and even kind of worked, so we cut that one.

We'll turn the asteroid belt into ball bearings to go between different rings orbiting at different speeds.
We're also stuck with blurry, juddery, slow-panning 24fps movies forever because (thanks to 60fps home video) people associate high framerates with camcorders and cheap sitcoms, and thus think good framerates look 'fake'.
We're firing you, but the online headline-writing division wants to hire you.
We're going to have to work together to get over our hangups if we're going to learn to move on Catan's hexagonal grid. It's bad enough that we lost our crew of pawns when we passed within firing range of Battleship.

We've gotten him up to 20% milk and cookies through an aggressive public campaign, but that seems to be his dietary limit. Anything above that and he starts developing nutritional deficiencies.
We've learned that weird spacing and diacritics in the methodology description are apparently the key to good research; luckily, we've developed an AI tool to help us figure out where to add them.
We've met! I remember you when you were thiiiis tall! [*holds a hand an inch above their head*]

What'll I say -- "I was staring at some cat vomit when I got the news?"
What's even worse is, a month ago they transferred me to work on the game I was already playing, and suddenly I found myself procrastinating by playing the one I'd been assigned before. It's possible they're onto me and this is all part of the plan.
What's that? You think I don't like the Peters map because I'm uncomfortable with having my cultural assumptions challenged?  Are you sure you're not ... ::puts on sunglasses:: ... projecting?
What's the complexity class of the best linear programming cutting-plane techniques?  I couldn't find it anywhere.  Man, the Garfield guy doesn't have these problems ...

When I was a kid, I asked my parents why our houses didn't have toothpaste pipes in addition to water ones. I'm strangely pleased to see Amazon thinking the same way.
When I was a kid, someone told me the end of The Giver was ambiguous, which surprised me. I had just assumed Jonah died--because the book had a medal on the cover, and I knew grown-ups liked stories where sad stuff happens at the end for no reason.
When I was little I had trouble telling my dad apart from the dog. I always recognized my mom because she had a bunch of extra plutoniums in her middle. I never did ask her why ...
When I was looking at the box, I should have thought more about what "360 degrees of freedom" meant.
When Salvador Dalí died, it took months to get all the flagpoles sufficiently melted.

Whenever I see a picture of the moon where the points go more than halfway around, I assume it's being eclipsed by one of those Independence Day ships and interpret the rest of the image in light of that.
Whenever you see a video of birds doing something weird, remember: Birds are a small subset of dinosaurs, so the weirdness of birds is a small subset of the weirdness of dinosaurs.
Where I live, one of the most common categories of sky object without a weird obsessive spotting community is "lost birthday party balloons," so that might be a good choice—although you risk angering the marine wildlife people, and they have sharks.
Where did you even get this wall? Return it there and stand it back up right now.
Which is, coincidentally, the most unsettling mantlepiece decoration in my house.
Which, at one point, led to a study showing that LSD produces no more hallucinations than a placebo.
While it may seem like trivia, it (causes huge headaches for software developers / is taken advantage of by high-speed traders / triggered the 2003 Northeast Blackout / has to be corrected for by GPS satellites / is now recognized as a major cause of World War I).
While our commitment to recycling initiatives has been unwavering, this is not a cost any of us should be expected to pay.
While there's no formal regulation, it turns out their industry group is NOT one you want mad at you.
Who can forget the early 2010s memes? 'You know you're a 90s kid if you remember the feeling of warm sunlight on your face.' 'Only 90s kids remember the dawn.'
Who knew you could learn so much about sexual reproduction from looking at pictures on the internet!
Who's calling me?? WHY IS THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD CALLING ME!?
Whoa, and if you overlay a Fibonacci spiral on a golden spiral it matches up almost perfectly!

Why are we spending billions to ruin Mars with swarms of robots when Elon Musk has promised to ruin Mars for a FRACTION of the cost?
Why can't you have normal existential angst like all the other boys?
Why couldn't the amulet have been hidden by Aunt Alice, who understands modern key exchange algorithms?

Why did we even have that thing?
Why do all my attempts at science end with me being punched by Batman?  (P.S. benzoyl peroxide soap works great.)
Why would anyone ever, ever say that?  Please, nobody ever say that.

Wikipedia trivia: if you take any article, click on the first link in the article text not in parentheses or italics, and then repeat, you will eventually end up at "Philosophy".
Wikipedia's role as brain-extension, while a little troubling, is also really cool.
Will there ever be a physics term greater than 'tachyonic antitelephone?' According to this message from the future, the answer is 'no.'
Wishbone and the Illustrated Classics series have gotten me through every conversation I've ever had about Dickens, Treasure Island, The Anarchist's Cookbook, and Our Bodies, Ourselves.
With a space elevator, a backyard full of solar panels could launch about 500 horses per year, and a large power plant could launch 10 horses per minute.
With just one extra line, he could have anticipated the 2003 film The Core, but some things are too audacious for even the greatest visionaries.
With most labs, the hushed horror stories are about something like dimethylmercury or prions, but occasionally you'll get a weird lab where it's about the soda machine or the drop ceiling.
With reasonable assumptions about latitude and body shape, how much time might she gain them?  Note: whatever the answer, sunrise always comes too soon. (Also, is it worth it if she throws up?)
With the right 90-degree rotation, any effect is a side effect.
Within a few minutes, our roads will be full of uncontrollably-swerving cars and our skies full of Amazon delivery dogs.
Within five minutes of the Singularity appearing, somebody will suggest defragging it.

Wow, ANIMORPHS-NOVEL.RTF? Just gonna, uh, go through and delete that from all my archives real quick.
Wow, rude of you to regift literally every gift that you or anyone else has ever received.
Wow, that's less than $200 per ... uh ... that's a good deal!
Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy called the man's arguments that he could be either Alito or Ginsburg "surprisingly compelling, but ultimately unconvincing."
YEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHH!
YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?
Yeah, my math teacher back in high school set up the system to try to teach us something or other, but the 100% rate was unbelievably good, so I engineered a hostile takeover of his bank and now use it to make extra cash on the side.
Yes you are!  And you're sitting there!  Hi, kitty!
Yes, Eminem is wearing a sleeveless hoodie.  What of it?
Yes, I mean she said that during sex.  Yes, it was a little weird.
Yes, I understand that the turn is half a mile past the big field, but my GPS knows that, too.  This would be easier if you weren't about to ask me to repeat it all back to you.
Yes, it took a lot of work to make the cards and pieces, but it's worth it--the players are way more thorough than the tax prep people ever were.
Yes, there are a lot of longing looks across the bridge of Galactica first, but that's beside the point!
Yet one more reason I'm barred from speaking at crypto conferences.
You ARE getting older, though.
You absolute-fucking-... shit.
You also refuse to buy Cisco products because you hate the Thong Song, O. Henry, Deep Space Nine, freshwater whitefish, teenaged Incan emperors, Brak's brother, and vegetable-based shortening.
You can also just ignore any science assertion where 'quantum mechanics' is the most complicated phrase in it.
You can also just mash the keyboard at random, but you might end up with a gibberish name no one can pronounce.
You can also try 'Yikes.'
You can apply special translucent films to your windows to help keep birds/Superman from accidentally flying into them.

You can click to preorder to get a copy of What If? 2 when it comes out 9/13, assuming we all make it past the spider situation(?) on Tuesday(?).
You can come on in, we're all fully vaccinated. Except the spare room off the living room. Don't go in there, we're not fully vaccinated in there.
You can do a lot better than 1% if you start keeping track of the patterns in what numbers people pick.
You can do this one in every 30 times and still have 97% positive feedback.
You can either hang out in the Android Loop or the HURD loop.
You can evade blue shells in Double Dash, but it is deep magic.
You can find a perfect correlation if you just control for the residual.
You can identify them ahead-of-time -- they lead with their left foot when the music starts.
You can just see his dejection as he realizes he's the lead guitar in 'Hedgeclipper'
You can leave at any time through the door over there. It's a Louisville door, so you'll need to find a compatible knob. No, don't be silly, that one is a Lexington knob! Of course it won't fit.
You can look at practically any part of anything manmade around you and think 'some engineer was frustrated while designing this.'  It's a little human connection.
You can pour a drink into it while hosting a party, although it's a real pain to fit in the dishwasher afterward.
You can search it if you want, but you may want to skip the memories of your mom.
You can still do powerline networking, but the bitrate does drop a little depending on the lightbulb warmup and cooldown delay.
You can tell most people don’t really assign an absolute meaning to these numbers because in some places and time periods, “billion” has meant 1,000x what it's meant in others, and a lot of us never even noticed.
You can't stab Carl Kasell. He sounds all slow and stentorian, but he moves like a snake.
You could at least not wear the lab coat everywhere, dude.
You didn't run a chemical analysis against the Shroud of Turin?  Man, all that work for NOTHING.
You don't use science to show that you're right, you use science to become right.
You fancy me mad. Could a madman have outsmarted the greatest electronica/techno artists of our era? Next to fall will be Roderick Usher's house/trance band.
You have to be careful doing this. Sometimes, when you push the whisker down, dynamite explodes.
You know I've always hated her.
You know how Einstein figured out that the speed of light was constant, and everything else had to change for consistency? My theory is like his, except not smart or good.
You know that 'sweep the pieces off the board and see it in your mind' thing?  Doesn't work.
You know that I'll never leave you. Not as long as she's with someone.
You know what happens when you assert--you make an ass out of the emergency response team.
You know what really helps an existential crisis? Wondering how much shelf space to leave for a Terry Pratchett collection.
You know what they say--if you don't like the weather here in the Solar System, just wait five billion years.
You know what they say: mRNA-1273 before tozinameran, you'll have to slay a banshee in a catamaran.
You know when you can't hear your speakers, and you keep turning various volume controls up higher and higher in confusion, and then someone hits the mute button and there's a deafening blast of sound? That's basically what happened at Chernobyl.
You know, pep rallies weirded me out in high school, and they've only gotten creepier in retrospect.
You laugh to keep from crying, you do math to keep from crying . . .
You make forgetting look so easy.
You may point out that strictly speaking, you can use that statement to prove that all risks are tiny--to which I reply HOLY SHIT WATCH OUT FOR THAT DOG!
You may point out that this very retreat into ironic detachment while still clearly participating in the thing in question is the very definition of contemporary hipsterdom. But on the other hand, wait, you're in an empty room. Who are you talking to?
You might think most people you know are reliable voters, or that your nudge won't convince them, and you will usually be right. But some small but significant percentage of the time, you'll be wrong, and that's why this works.
You might want to bring your frost-sensitive plants in from the patio. The high-level aerosols may result in short-term cooling across the entire backyard.
You roll for initiative, and ... [roll] ... wow, do you ever take it.
You say this daily walk will reduce my risk of death from cardiovascular disease by 30%, but also increase my risk of death by bear attack by 300%? That's a 280% increased! I'm not a sucker; I'm staying inside.
You should start giving out 'E's so I can spell FACADE or DEFACED.
You should talk to the girl down the hall; I think you'd like her.  Lemme know if you find out why she's ordering all those colored plastic balls.
You shouldn't look directly at a partial eclipse because of the damage that can be caused by improperly aligning the solar-lunar orbital plane with the orbital bones around your eye.
You spin me right round, baby, right round, in a manner depriving me of an inertial reference frame.  Baby.
You think it's so legendarily bad that you'll torrent it and sit through it just for the kitschy nerd cred. I, too, once thought as you did.
You think, 'okay, THIS is an ideal use case for hardlinks!' but then 6 months later you're doing some extremely cursed Google search like 'javascript ext4' and wondering where things went wrong.
You want me to pick up waffle cones? Oh, right, for the wine. One sec, let me just derive your son's credit card number and I'll be on my way.
You were on the internet before I was born? Well, so was I.
You will be led to judgement like lambs to the slaughter--a simile whose existence, I might add, will not do your species any favors.
You will live on forever in our hearts, pushing a little extra blood toward our left hands now and then to give them a squeeze.
You'd need to keep track of so many people! Would you use, like, Excel or something? Far too fancy for a simple country nanoenzyme developer like me.
You'd think 'linguistics' would go to someone important in the field, but it's actually assigned to a random student in Ohio who barely graduated and then went into automotive marketing.
You'd think it'd be easy to just bet money against these people, but you have to consider the probability of them paying up.
You'll be moved up from 49 of ~7 billion to 31 of ~7 billion.
You're a turtle!
You're probably thinking, 'has it been a decade?'  It's been over thirteen years, buddy.
You're saying that the responsibility for avoiding miscommunication lies entirely with the listener, not the speaker, which explains why you haven't been able to convince anyone to help you down from that wall.
You've got questions, we've got assumptions.
Younger people get very few joint replacements, yet they're also getting more than older people did at the same age. This means you can choose between 'Why are millennials getting so (many/few) joint replacements?' depending on which trend fits your current argument better.
Your IDE's color may vary.
Your manuscript "Don't Pay $25 to Access Any of the Articles in this Journal: A Review of Preprint Repositories and Author Willingness to Email PDF Copies for Free" has also been rejected, but nice try.
Your point that the world contains multiple problems is a real slam-dunk argument against fixing any of them.
Your problem is so terrible, I worry that, if I help you, I risk drawing the attention of whatever god of technology inflicted it on you.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they should, they didn't stop to think if they could.
Zero results: 'snake charming' and 'haberdashery'.  (Things like 'car' and 'boating' and such are of course the highest, by a huge margin.)

[hair in face] "SEVVVENNN YEEEARRRSSS"
[holding up a three-phase motor] As you can see here, the problem is that the humidifier I took this from is broken.
[later] I can't believe how bad corruption has become, especially given that our league split off from the statewide one a month ago SPECIFICALLY to protest this kind of flagrantly biased judging.
[moments later, checking phone] Okay, I agree my posting it was weird, but it's somehow even more unnerving that you immediately liked the post.
